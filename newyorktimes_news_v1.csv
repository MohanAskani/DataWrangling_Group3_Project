"The lawsuit accuses President Trump of vastly overstepping his authority to “upturn the electoral playing field in his favor and against his political rivals.”",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The lawsuit accuses President Trump of vastly overstepping his authority to “upturn the electoral playing field in his favor and against his political rivals.” By Nick Corasaniti Nearly every arm of the Democratic Party united in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Monday night, arguing that a recent executive order signed by the president seeking to require documentary proof of citizenship and other voting reforms is unconstitutional. The 70-page lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., accuses the president of vastly overstepping his authority to “upturn the electoral playing field in his favor and against his political rivals.” It lists President Trump and multiple members of his administration as defendants. “Although the order extensively reflects the president’s personal grievances, conspiratorial beliefs and election denialism, nowhere does it (nor could it) identify any legal authority he possesses to impose such sweeping changes upon how Americans vote,” the lawsuit says. “The reason why is clear: The president possesses no such authority.” The lawsuit repeatedly argues that the Constitution gives the president no explicit authority to regulate elections, noting that the Elections Clause of the Constitution “is at the core of this action.” That clause says that states set the “times, places and manner” of elections, leaving them to decide the rules, oversee voting and try to prevent fraud. Congress may also pass federal voting laws. As Democrats debate how best to challenge the Trump administration’s rapid expansion of executive power, the lawsuit represents one of the first moments where seemingly every arm of the party is pushing back with one voice. Such unity is further evidence that Democrats still view the issue of democracy as core to their political brand, as well as a key issue that can help them claw back support with voters as they aim to build a new coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. In February, Democrats sued the Trump administration over attempts to control the Federal Election Commission. Weeks earlier, the D.N.C. joined a lawsuit over new voting laws in Georgia.

"Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, mandated that physical fitness requirements for combat jobs be “sex-neutral,” a move that is likely to significantly reduce the number of women who qualify.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, mandated that physical fitness requirements for combat jobs be “sex-neutral,” a move that is likely to significantly reduce the number of women who qualify. By Chris Cameron Reporting from Washington The Pentagon this week ordered the elimination of lower physical fitness standards for women in combat units, a move that is likely to hinder the recruitment and retention of women in particularly dangerous military jobs. An order by Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, dated Sunday and announced on Monday, mandated that all physical fitness requirements for combat arms positions — units likely to see significant fighting in wartime — be “sex-neutral,” which is likely to significantly reduce the number of women who meet the requirements. The order directs military leadership to implement the new fitness standards by the end of October. The U.S. military has fiercely debated the issue of how to fairly grade women’s physical fitness in testing to determine their placement into physically demanding combat jobs and their advancement in leadership roles. After years of internal deliberation over new annual fitness tests, the Army eased the grading standards for women and older service members in 2022. A study by the RAND research corporation published that year found that women and older troops were failing the new test at significantly higher rates than men and younger troops. Other branches of the military have also had different fitness test standards for men and women. For example, the Marines have a strength test for all recruits: Men must complete three pull-ups or 34 push-ups in under two minutes. Women must complete one pull-up or 15 push-ups in the same time frame. Those gender-specific standards will remain for some military jobs, Mr. Hegseth said in a statement accompanying the order. But he argued that women should not be allowed in combat units if they could not meet the same fitness standards as men. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The state attorney general had raised the possibility of charging doctors with criminal conspiracy for recommending abortion care out of state.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The state attorney general had raised the possibility of charging doctors with criminal conspiracy for recommending abortion care out of state. By Emily Cochrane Emily Cochrane covers the American South. Alabama cannot prosecute doctors and reproductive health organizations for helping patients travel out of the state to obtain abortions, a federal judge ruled on Monday. Alabama has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, and in 2022 its attorney general, Steve Marshall, a Republican, raised the possibility of charging doctors with criminal conspiracy for recommending abortion care out of state. Multiple clinics and doctors challenged Mr. Marshall’s comments in court, accusing him of threatening their First Amendment rights, as well as the constitutional right to travel. The Justice Department under the Biden administration had also weighed in with support for the clinics, arguing that “threatened criminal prosecutions violate a bedrock principle of American constitutional law.” On Monday, the judge, Myron H. Thompson of the Middle District of Alabama, in Montgomery, ruled that Mr. Marshall would be violating both the First Amendment and the right to travel if he sought prosecution. “It is one thing for Alabama to outlaw by statute what happens in its own backyard,” Judge Thompson, who was named to the court by President Jimmy Carter, wrote in his 131-page opinion. “It is another thing,” he added, “for the state to enforce its values and laws, as chosen by the attorney general, outside its boundaries by punishing its citizens and others who help individuals travel to another state to engage in conduct that is lawful there but the attorney general finds to be contrary to Alabama’s values and laws.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Harvard, the wealthiest school in the world, sought compromise amid pressure to do more to combat antisemitism. The Trump administration is examining its funding anyway.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Harvard, the wealthiest school in the world, sought compromise amid pressure to do more to combat antisemitism. The Trump administration is examining its funding anyway. By Vimal Patel The Trump administration has turned campaign promises to target universities into devastating action, pulling hundreds of millions in federal funds from Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania. On Monday, the Trump administration went after Harvard, the world’s wealthiest university, announcing that it would review about $9 billion in contracts and multiyear grants. It accused the university of failing to protect Jewish students and promoting “divisive ideologies over free inquiry.” Harvard had been bracing for the development. In recent months, it had moved cautiously, seeking compromise and, critics said, cracking down on speech. The approach riled some who worried that Harvard was capitulating at a moment of creeping authoritarianism. Though it remains unclear how much the university will actually lose, if anything, the move on Monday shows that the conciliatory approach hasn’t fended off its critics yet. In the days leading up to the Trump administration’s announcement, faculty members called on the university instead to more forcefully defend itself and higher education more broadly. In a letter, more than 700 faculty members called for Harvard to “mount a coordinated opposition to these anti-democratic attacks.” “As much as a body blow from the administration would hurt us, Harvard has the capacity to withstand the blow,” said Steven Levitsky, a Harvard political science professor who circulated the letter.

"President Trump justifies his plan to shutter the Education Department by saying that states should control schools. He’s using the idea to explain other policies now, too.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by President Trump justifies his plan to shutter the Education Department by saying that states should control schools. He’s using the idea to explain other policies now, too. By Michael C. Bender Reported from Washington President Trump’s interest in closing down the Education Department was never front and center to any of his three White House campaigns, but his explanation for shuttering the agency has always remained consistent. “Move it back to the states,” Mr. Trump said in his third month as a candidate in 2015. In the final days of the 2024 race, he told supporters, “Your state is going to control your children’s education.” Very little control over education has ever resided with the federal government, which is mainly in charge of administering college loans and enforcing civil rights in schools. Even so, Mr. Trump deployed the back-to-the-states mantra again when signing an executive order on March 20 to close the department. The title of the order was: “Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities.” The maneuver has long been a calling card of politicians from the conservative establishment advocating a smaller federal government and more local control, and is now a central tenet of the second Trump administration when it comes to a host of issues, from abortion and cutting regulations to hiking tariffs. But states are not necessarily positioned to replicate the oversight functions that the federal government has played, particularly on education matters. Mr. Trump used the tactic during the 2024 presidential race to sidestep questions about abortion rights by saying that states should decide the issue — a particularly brazen move after he stacked the Supreme Court with conservative judges to overturn Roe v. Wade. More recently, Mr. Trump and others in his administration have pushed to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency, saying states would do a better job. The move appears to ignore the agency’s core principle that the best practice for disaster relief is “locally executed, state managed, and federally supported.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"A Senate hearing on Tuesday could be just the first exercise in needle-threading for Lt. Gen. Dan Caine as he tries to maintain credibility with President Trump while staying true to military norms.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Signal Leaks Advertisement Supported by A Senate hearing on Tuesday could be just the first exercise in needle-threading for Lt. Gen. Dan Caine as he tries to maintain credibility with President Trump while staying true to military norms. By Sharon LaFraniere and Eric Schmitt Reported from Washington Lt. Gen. Dan Caine’s pocket-size copy of the Constitution is tattered and bound with green military tape. He carries it with him routinely, including slipping it in his flight suit when he flew fighter jets in the Air Force. He had it on him on Sept. 11, 2001, when he was the lead aviator assigned to protect Washington after hijackers slammed commercial jets into the Pentagon and the World Trade Center. General Caine’s loyalty to the Constitution and his reputation for adhering to ethical standards are major reasons the Senate Armed Services Committee is likely to give him a largely friendly reception on Tuesday as the members consider his nomination to become the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the nation’s highest-ranking military position. General Caine’s writings, coupled with interviews with some who know him, paint a portrait of a modest, thoughtful and personable officer with a reputation for integrity. That sets him apart from some other high-ranking administration officials who often appear to place their fealty to the president above all else. “He has strong moral fiber,” said Raj Shah, who led a high-level Defense Department unit on innovation and has known General Caine for 20 years. He added, “He is one of the most humble, principled and strategic leaders I have known.” But General Caine will still have to navigate some tough questions about whether he will give his best unvarnished military advice to President Trump or tell him what he wants to hear.

He eclipsed Strom Thurmond’s filibuster of a civil rights bill in 1957. transcript “The Senator from New Jersey.” “I just want to tell you what John Lewis said. It’s a quote so many people know. He said, “get in good trouble, necessary trouble.” So tonight, I rise with the intention of getting in some good trouble. I rise with the intention of disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as I am physically able. In just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans’ safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy and even our aspirations as a people for — from our highest offices, a sense of common decency. This is a moral moment. It’s not left to right. It’s right or wrong. Let’s get in good trouble. My friend, madam president, I yield the floor.” By Tim BalkMike Ives and Matthew Mpoke Bigg Senator Cory Booker, his voice still booming after more than a day spent on the Senate floor railing against the Trump administration, on Tuesday night surpassed Strom Thurmond for the longest Senate speech on record, in an act of astonishing stamina that he framed as a call to action. Mr. Booker, a New Jersey Democrat and one-time presidential candidate, began his speech at 7 p.m. on Monday, vowing to speak as long as he was “physically able.” In a show of physical and oratorical endurance, he lasted past sunset on Tuesday, assailing President Trump’s cuts to government agencies and crackdown on immigration. He ended his speech at 8:05 p.m., 46 minutes after eclipsing Mr. Thurmond’s 24-hour 18-minute filibuster of a civil rights bill in 1957. He finished by quoting John Lewis, the civil rights hero and congressman. Mr. Booker said of Lewis: “He said for us to go out and cause some good trouble, necessary trouble, to redeem the soul of our nation. I want you to redeem the dream. Let’s be bold in America.” Earlier, cheers broke out in the chamber when Mr. Booker passed Mr. Thurmond. For a moment, Mr. Booker addressed the man he had eclipsed. “To hate him is wrong, and maybe my ego got too caught up that if I stood here, maybe, maybe, just maybe, I could break this record of the man who tried to stop the rights upon which I stand,” Mr. Booker said. “I’m not here though because of his speech. I’m here despite his speech. I’m here because as powerful as he was, the people were more powerful.” Earlier, at 4:20 p.m., Mr. Booker passed Senator Ted Cruz’s memorable 21-hour-and-19-minute harangue of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act in 2013. As the hours dragged on Tuesday and Mr. Booker kept speaking, tens of thousands followed along on livestreams, curious to see how long he might go.

"Momodou Taal, a Ph.D. student who had been suspended by the university after participating in pro-Palestinian protests, said he “took the decision to leave the United States.”",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Momodou Taal, a Ph.D. student who had been suspended by the university after participating in pro-Palestinian protests, said he “took the decision to leave the United States.” By Matthew Mpoke Bigg A British-Gambian Ph.D. student at Cornell University who had faced possible deportation after participating in pro-Palestinian protests said on Monday that he had left the United States. The student, Momodou Taal, who had been suspended by the university at least twice, including for participating in what it said was an unruly protest, is one of at least nine international students who the Trump administration has sought to remove from the country because of activities it calls antisemitic. Mr. Taal had not been detained, unlike some of the other students, and had filed a suit attempting to block the legal proceedings against him. In a statement on the social media platform X, Mr. Taal indicated that he had left the country. “I took the decision to leave the United States, free and with my head held high,” Mr. Taal wrote. He said that federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel had come to his home and revoked his visa. The agency referred a request for comment to the Department of Homeland Security. “Given what we have seen across the United States, I have lost faith that a favorable ruling from the courts would guarantee my personal safety and ability to express my beliefs,” he said in the statement. He warned that others were also at risk, and renewed his support for Palestinians. Mr. Taal had been one of the leaders of a tent protest on the campus lawn at Cornell, in Ithaca, N.Y., in which students urged the university to divest its holdings in companies that they said supported Israel’s military campaign against Hamas militants in Gaza. On Oct. 7, 2023, the day that Hamas attacked Israel and set off the war, he wrote online, “Glory to the Resistance.” After returning to office in January, President Trump signed an executive order saying that the United States would use “all available and appropriate legal tools” to “remove” aliens who engage in “unlawful antisemitic harassment and violence.” Last month, ICE personnel detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student. They have also sought others, including Yunseo Chung, a legal permanent resident who moved to the United States from South Korea when she was 7. Officials in the Trump administration have argued in several cases that a “visa is a privilege, not a right.” Civil rights advocates have called the deportation effort one of the biggest assaults on free speech in the United States in decades. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed in a statement that Mr. Taal had left the country and said, “It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism, that privilege should be revoked.” Mr. Taal, who holds joint British and Gambian citizenship, was in the United States on a student visa. He had been working toward a Ph.D. in Africana studies. Matthew Mpoke Bigg is a London-based reporter on the Live team at The Times, which covers breaking and developing news.

"Brad Lander, the comptroller, said Elon Musk’s actions on behalf of the Trump administration had hurt Tesla’s stock price.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Brad Lander, the comptroller, said Elon Musk’s actions on behalf of the Trump administration had hurt Tesla’s stock price. By Jeffery C. Mays The head of New York City’s pension funds called for a shareholder lawsuit against Tesla, accusing Elon Musk, its chief executive, of causing the company’s shares to plunge because of his actions to slash spending and the federal work force as head of the Trump administration’s cost-cutting effort. In a letter sent late Monday to the New York City Law Department and reviewed by The New York Times, Brad Lander, the comptroller who oversees the city’s five public pension funds, said the highly contested cost-cutting measures by Mr. Musk’s initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency, are hurting Tesla’s stock. He accused Mr. Musk, the world’s richest person, of “effectively quitting his job at Tesla” and “promoting policies” that have been harmful to Tesla’s business. “As the market has learned the truth, bit by bit, that Musk has in fact abandoned Tesla in favor of DOGE, where he was taking actions that alienated Tesla’s consumer base and causing Tesla’s sales to severely decline, the share price has dropped in response,” Mr. Lander wrote in a letter to Muriel Goode-Trufant, the corporation counsel for New York City. The letter was seen as a likely precursor to a lawsuit because Ms. Goode-Trufant is the lawyer for the pension funds. As a result, the letter said, the value of the pension system’s Tesla holdings has dropped by 34 percent from Dec. 31 to March 28, to $831 million from $1.26 billion. Mr. Lander, in an interview, said that Tesla had emphasized the importance of Mr. Musk’s involvement to the electric car maker’s success, but had falsely represented that he spends “significant time on the company and is highly active” in its management. He said that he hoped the lawsuit will help recover some of the losses and compel Tesla to make policy and governance changes. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Schmidt and Maggie Haberman President Trump announced Tuesday another deal with a law firm he had targeted for potential punishment, this time the one that employs Doug Emhoff, former Vice President Kamala Harris’s husband. Mr. Trump did not say why he targeted the firm. Along with its connection to Mr. Trump’s defeated opponent in the November election, the firm also employs a top investigator for the congressional committee that documented President Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and a litigator who spearheaded a lawsuit that two Georgia election workers brought against Rudolph W. Giuliani in which he was ordered to pay the women $148 million. The deal between Mr. Trump and the firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, is similar to ones reached by other top law firms in recent weeks with Mr. Trump. Willkie, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post, committed to representing clients, no matter their political leanings, and pledged $100 million in pro bono legal work to causes Mr. Trump has championed. The firm, Mr. Trump said, would “not engage in illegal DEI discrimination and preferences,” Mr. Trump announced in a Truth Social post. The executive orders Mr. Trump has leveled against the law firms are widely seen in the legal community as illegal and undemocratic and have been highly criticized by Democrats, legal experts and judges. Those firms that have cut deals with Mr. Trump have been criticized for bending to Mr. Trump simply to protect their bottom lines, and it’s unclear how the deals will be executed and enforced by the administration.

"Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was in the U.S. legally, is now in prison in El Salvador, and federal courts have no jurisdiction to order his release, the Trump administration said in a court filing.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was in the U.S. legally, is now in prison in El Salvador, and federal courts have no jurisdiction to order his release, the Trump administration said in a court filing. By Ali Watkins and Alan Feuer A Maryland man who was in the United States legally was deported to El Salvador and imprisoned there because of an “administrative error,” Trump administration officials said in a court filing on Monday, adding that American courts lacked the jurisdiction to have him released. The man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, had lived in the United States under protected legal status since October 2019. His wife and 5-year-old child are both U.S. citizens. On March 12, Mr. Abrego Garcia was stopped by immigration agents who told him inaccurately that his status had changed, according to court documents. Mr. Abrego Garcia had “withholding from removal” status, which means he was the subject of a deportation order but was allowed to stay in the United States because of the likelihood that he could be harmed if he returned to El Salvador. Three days later, Mr. Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador, and he is now being held in its sprawling Terrorism Confinement Center, a so-called mega prison known as CECOT. In the court filing, Trump administration officials said there was nothing they could do to correct the error, given that Mr. Abrego Garcia was no longer in U.S. custody. His deportation was first reported by The Atlantic. Mr. Abrego Garcia’s inadvertent deportation is the latest twist in a pitched battle between immigration lawyers and the White House over the administration’s efforts to deport migrants to El Salvador under both traditional and highly unorthodox procedures. Mr. Abrego Garcia was placed on one of three flights to El Salvador on March 15 as the Trump administration was hastily ramping up its efforts to use a rarely invoked wartime statute, known as the Alien Enemies Act, to deport scores of Venezuelan immigrants accused of being members of the street gang Tren de Aragua.

Kennedy Jr. By Sheryl Gay StolbergChristina Jewett and Apoorva Mandavilli The Trump administration laid off thousands of federal health workers on Tuesday in a purge that included senior leaders and top scientists charged with regulating food and drugs, protecting Americans from disease and researching new treatments and cures. Layoff notices began arriving at 5 a.m., workers said, affecting offices responsible for everything from global health to food safety. Senior officials based in the Washington area and Atlanta were reassigned to the Indian Health Service and asked to choose among locations including Alaska, Oklahoma and New Mexico — a tactic to force people out, employees said. The layoffs and reassignments touch every aspect of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, and are part of what the administration has said is a vast restructuring of the agency. Entire units focused on reproductive health and preventing gun injuries were wiped out. So was a vaccine research program aimed at preventing the next pandemic. On Tuesday afternoon, Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and chairman of the Senate health committee, summoned Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to testify about the agency reorganization at a hearing on April 10. Outside experts and former officials said the loss of expertise was immeasurable. Many described it as a “bloodletting.” Hundreds of people, many carrying handmade signs, gathered in the lobby of a National Cancer Institute building in the Maryland suburbs on Tuesday morning to witness the exodus of fired workers, but were dispersed so they could walk out without fanfare. Some employees, both current and former, were in tears. But as staff members reeled and comforted one another, Mr. Kennedy posted a video on social media that showed him swearing in the new heads of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Martin A. Makary, and the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"A crackdown targeting foreign students protesting Israel’s treatment of Palestinians conflicts with free-speech protections that lawmakers added in 1990.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by A crackdown targeting foreign students protesting Israel’s treatment of Palestinians conflicts with free-speech protections that lawmakers added in 1990. By Charlie Savage Charlie Savage writes about presidential power and legal policy. The Trump administration is asserting that it has broad power under a 1952 law to kick out foreign students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests. That statute says the secretary of state can deem noncitizens deportable for foreign policy reasons, and the secretary, Marco Rubio, made it clear recently that he had already used it to cancel hundreds of student visas. “It might be more than 300 at this point,” Mr. Rubio said last week. “We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa.” But that expansive conception of power appears to conflict with a key limit Congress added nearly four decades after the law passed. Lawmakers explained that the modification, which is recorded elsewhere in federal statute books, means the law may be used “only in unusual circumstances” and “sparingly” if the problem stems from foreigners’ exercise of free speech. Lawmakers also gave two examples of when deporting someone under the 1952 law over speech would still be legitimate. Both scenarios, laid out in a report explaining the 1990 bill that enacted the restriction, were highly exceptional. The first was if a particular foreigner’s mere presence in the United States would somehow violate a treaty. The other was if it “could result in imminent harm to the lives or property” of Americans abroad, like when allowing the former shah of Iran to come to the United States in 1979 led to a riot at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and a hostage crisis. The additional guardrails raise questions over what rights foreign students are entitled to and underscore the Trump administration’s far-ranging interpretation of its authority in aggressively moving to deport those who have protested Israel’s war in Gaza. The executive branch has broad discretion to deny visas to applicants while they are abroad. But once noncitizens are on American soil, they are protected by the Constitution, which includes the rights to free speech and due process. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The president did not reveal the details of his plan to impose reciprocal tariffs the same day, but suggested he would move ahead with import taxes on trading partners.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The president did not reveal the details of his plan to impose reciprocal tariffs the same day, but suggested he would move ahead with import taxes on trading partners. By Tony RommAna Swanson and Jeanna Smialek President Trump has settled on a final plan for sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs, which are expected to take effect on Wednesday after he announces the details at an afternoon Rose Garden ceremony. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, confirmed the timeline in a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, adding that Mr. Trump had been huddling with his trade team to hash out the finer points of an approach meant to end “decades of unfair trade practices.” When pressed on whether the administration was worried the tariffs could prove to be the wrong approach, Ms. Leavitt struck a confident note: “They’re not going to be wrong,” she said. “It is going to work.” The administration has been weighing several different tariff strategies in recent weeks. One option examined by the White House is a 20 percent flat tariff on all imports, which advisers have said could help raise more than $6 trillion in revenue for the U.S. government. But advisers have also discussed the idea of assigning different tariff levels to countries depending on the trade barriers those countries impose against American products. They have also said that some nations might avoid tariffs entirely by striking trade deals with the United States. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Mr. Trump said the United States would be “very nice, relatively speaking,” in imposing tariffs on a vast number of countries — including U.S. allies — that he believes are unfairly inhibiting the flow of American exports.

"The attorney general said the decision to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, who is accused of murdering an insurance executive, was in keeping with an executive order by President Trump.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","C.E.O. Shooting Advertisement Supported by The attorney general said the decision to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, who is accused of murdering an insurance executive, was in keeping with an executive order by President Trump. By Glenn Thrush and Hurubie Meko Glenn Thrush reported from Washington, and Hurubie Meko from New York. Attorney General Pam Bondi said on Tuesday that she would seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, who was charged with murdering a UnitedHealthcare executive in Manhattan last year, part of a push to revive the widespread use of capital punishment in federal cases. Ms. Bondi said her decision came after “careful consideration” and was in line with President Trump’s executive order directing the Justice Department to renew death penalty requests after President Biden declared a moratorium on capital punishment for most federal offenders in 2021. The move, which was widely anticipated, represented the intersection of Mr. Trump’s eagerness to impose the death penalty with a headline-grabbing murder case — the brazen public killing of Brian Thompson, a 50-year-old health care executive targeted because Mr. Mangione saw him as a symbol of callous corporate greed, according to prosecutors. “Luigi Mangione’s murder of Brian Thompson — an innocent man and father of two young children — was a premeditated, coldblooded assassination that shocked America,” Ms. Bondi said in a statement. Ms. Bondi directed Matthew Podolsky, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, to seek the death penalty. Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the office, which has been prosecuting Mr. Mangione’s federal case, declined to comment on Tuesday. In a statement, one of Mr. Mangione’s defense lawyers, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, said that seeking the death penalty in the case amounted to “premeditated, state-sponsored murder” intended to protect the “immoral” health care industry.

"The party’s rank and file are angry and searching for a Democrat who can lead the way.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The party’s rank and file are angry and searching for a Democrat who can lead the way. By Christina Morales and Rick Rojas Before the election, Julisa Rojas believed that Democrats were by no means perfect, but she thought they could steer the country in a better direction. So, she said she canvassed neighborhoods in Georgia, where she helped register people to vote. Now, her hope has curdled into frustration — not just with President Donald J. Trump but with her own party. The Democrats’ response to an unrelenting Republican administration, she said, has seemed too scattershot and clumsy. When she saw them show up to Mr. Trump’s address to Congress in March wearing pink and holding matching signs, she scoffed. “A little pathetic, in my opinion,” she said. “I don’t think that they’ve done anything,” said Ms. Rojas, a 24-year-old literacy instructor. “But also, if they might’ve done something it could’ve been washed-out from all the news in regards to Trump since he’s doing something every day.” Her concern is shared by many rank-and-file Democrats, who believe the Republicans returned to power with a clear, aggressive and unsettling agenda, while their own party has yet to find its footing, much less coalesce into a formidable opposition. In roughly two dozen interviews across the country over the past week, loyal Democratic voters expressed a hunger for the party to fight the Trump administration’s expansive view of presidential power, but they also discussed their uncertainty about whether the party has the gumption to do so effectively. While many liked certain politicians, ranging from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jasmine Crockett and Bernie Sanders to Chuck Schumer, they described feeling stranded in a political wilderness and yearning for leadership and strategies to guide them out of it. “The one thing all of us can agree on: Democrats across the country are angry, and they’re angry because there does not seem to be a unified fight,” said Bishop Reginald T. Jackson, 70, the presiding prelate of the African Methodist Episcopal Church for a swath of the Mid-Atlantic region. “The real question, the real issue: What the hell is it that Democrats are willing to fight for?” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Alan Blinder and Anemona Hartocollis The Trump administration moved this week to suspend dozens of federal grants to Princeton University, the fourth Ivy League school that has seen its financial support from Washington reduced or explicitly threatened since March. Christopher L. Eisgruber, Princeton’s president, told the university community in an email late Tuesday morning that “several dozen” grants had been suspended. “The full rationale for this action is not yet clear, but I want to be clear about the principles that will guide our response,” Mr. Eisgruber wrote. “Princeton University will comply with the law. We are committed to fighting antisemitism and all forms of discrimination, and we will cooperate with the government in combating antisemitism. Princeton will also vigorously defend academic freedom and the due process rights of this university.” Mr. Eisgruber said that the university had been told on Monday and Tuesday that it was losing at least some research support from the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and NASA. The university did not immediately announce the value of the affected grants. The White House did not immediately comment, but the Trump administration has eagerly pursued elite universities in recent weeks. The administration stripped Columbia University of $400 million in grants and contracts in March and later suspended about $175 million to the University of Pennsylvania. On Monday afternoon, the administration said it was reviewing approximately $9 billion in arrangements with Harvard University and its web of affiliates.

By Julie Bosman and Reid J. Epstein Reporting from Mount Pleasant, Wis., and Madison, Wis. Polls were closing on Tuesday evening in Wisconsin, where officials were counting ballots in a nearly $100 million race for control of the State Supreme Court. Steady streams of voters were reported through the day at polling places in a race that will decide the ideological tilt of the state’s high court and has drawn intense attention well beyond Wisconsin’s borders. Election officials said that early voting turnout had surpassed 600,000 votes, suggesting that total turnout could surpass two million. Late Tuesday, officials in Milwaukee said that the high turnout had caused ballot shortages, but they were rushing to replenish the supply. Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and White House adviser, has poured millions for advertisements and canvassing into the race, which has become the most expensive judicial race in American history. Mr. Musk, who has gained sweeping authority over the government through President Trump, has become a deeply polarizing figure among Wisconsinites — many of whom said they would like to see him stay out of their business. “Does my face say it all?” said Lydia Vela, 54, a banker who grimaced at the sound of Mr. Musk’s name. “He’s scary.” Ms. Vela, a Democrat, said she hoped that a victory for Judge Susan Crawford, the liberal State Supreme Court candidate, over the conservative contender, Brad Schimel, would send a message that billionaires like Mr. Musk should not take a role in local politics. The race is officially nonpartisan, but voters said they were well aware of the candidates’ political leanings and alliances. Get live results and maps from the 2025 Wisconsin spring elections.

"Supporters of the agency said its gutting could hurt minority-owned businesses that already face additional barriers to gaining capital.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Supporters of the agency said its gutting could hurt minority-owned businesses that already face additional barriers to gaining capital. By Madeleine Ngo Reporting from Washington The Trump administration’s move to gut an agency that aims to support minority-owned businesses has alarmed Democratic lawmakers and nonprofits, who say the action could harm job growth and businesses that rely on the agency’s services. President Trump signed an executive order last month that would effectively dismantle seven agencies “to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law,” including the Minority Business Development Agency. Housed in the Commerce Department, the agency funds more than three dozen centers across the country that provide technical assistance to minority-owned businesses with the goal of helping them secure loans and contracts. Nearly all of the agency’s roughly 70 workers were placed on administrative leave late last month, and only three employees remain, according to a person familiar with the matter. Democratic lawmakers have condemned the Trump administration’s actions. Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin urged the administration last week to immediately release details on its proposed cuts for the agency and how they could affect small business owners. In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick last week, Senators Maria Cantwell of Washington and Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware said that a major reduction of the agency’s work force would be “to the detriment of the U.S. economy” and have devastating effects on its ability to “carry out its programs and duties as mandated by Congress.” In the past fiscal year, the Minority Business Development Agency helped businesses gain access to more than $1.5 billion in capital and create or retain about 23,000 jobs, according to the agency’s annual report. Other proponents of the agency said its gutting could hurt minority-owned businesses that already face additional barriers to capital because of a lack of capacity, expertise or an expansive network, among other things.

"President Trump is already showing signs of concern that his targets may team up against him.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by News Analysis President Trump is already showing signs of concern that his targets may team up against him. By David E. Sanger David E. Sanger, who has covered six presidencies, writes often on the revival of superpower conflict, the subject of his latest book. The incoming German chancellor, more convinced than ever that the defense and trade relationship with Washington is crumbling, has made plans to execute on his goal of “independence from the U.S.A.” He’s not the only one. The new Canadian prime minister said last week that “the old relationship we had with the United States” — the tightest of military and economic partnerships — is now “over.” Poland’s president is musing publicly about getting nuclear weapons. And the new leader of Greenland, host to American air bases since World War II, reacted to the uninvited visit of a high-level American delegation with indignation. “President Trump says that the United States ‘will get Greenland,’” Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on social media. “Let me be clear: The United States will not get it. We do not belong to anyone else. We decide our own future.” These are the results so far of President Trump’s threats to abandon NATO allies whose contributions he judges insufficient, his declaration that the European Union was designed “to screw” the United States and his efforts to expand the United States’ land mass. The main reaction is resistance all around. Now, into this maelstrom of threats, alienation and recriminations, President Trump is expected to announce his “Liberation Day” tariffs on Wednesday. The details of the tariffs are still unclear, which is one reason the markets are so on edge. Political leaders are on edge as well, because Mr. Trump has made clear that the tariffs will fall on adversaries like China as well as nations that, until recently, were considered America’s closest defense and intelligence allies. Trump administration officials do not dwell on the price that will be paid by consumers, nor on the effects that the inevitable retaliation will have on American farmers. But just as curiously, the administration has not described any cost-benefit analysis of the president’s actions, such as whether the revenue gained is worth the damage done to America’s central alliances.

By Edward Wong Reporting from Washington Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered diplomats overseas to scrutinize the social media content of some applicants for student and other types of visas, in an effort to bar those suspected of criticizing the United States and Israel from entering the country, U.S. officials say. Mr. Rubio laid out the instructions in a long cable sent to diplomatic missions on March 25. The move came nine weeks after President Trump signed executive orders to start a campaign to deport some foreign citizens, including those who might have “hostile attitudes” toward American “citizens, culture, government, institutions or founding principles.” Mr. Trump also issued an executive order to begin a crackdown on what he called antisemitism, which includes deporting foreign students who have taken part in campus protests against Israel’s war in Gaza. Mr. Rubio’s directive said that starting immediately, consular officers must refer certain student and exchange visitor visa applicants to the “fraud prevention unit” for a “mandatory social media check,” according to two American officials with knowledge of the cable. The fraud prevention unit of an embassy’s or consulate’s section for consular affairs, which issues the visas, helps screen applicants. The cable described the broad parameters that diplomats should use to judge whether to deny a visa. It cited remarks that Mr. Rubio made in an interview with CBS News on March 16: “We don’t want people in our country that are going to be committing crimes and undermining our national security or the public safety,” he said. “It’s that simple, especially people that are here as guests.

By Mark Walker Reporting from Washington An air traffic controller was arrested on Thursday night after an incident in the control tower at Ronald Reagan National Airport, the police said in a statement. The controller, Damon Marsalis Gaines, 39, of Upper Marlboro, Md., was charged with assault and battery, according to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which runs National Airport and Dulles International Airport in Virginia. The authority, which has its own police force, did not disclose the details of what led to Mr. Gaines’s arrest. No injuries were reported. The Federal Aviation Administration, which manages air traffic operations at the airport, said in a statement that “the employee is on administrative leave while we investigate the matter.” The F.A.A. declined to comment on the events that led to the episode. It was not immediately clear whether the incident disrupted flight operations. Mr. Gaines did not respond to a request for comment. The arrest comes as flight operations at National Airport have fallen under harsh scrutiny since American Airlines Flight 5342 and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided on Jan. 29, killing all 67 people on both aircraft. The F.A.A. imposed new safety measures after the crash, including permanently closing a helicopter route near National Airport linked to the collision. Despite the agency’s efforts, aviation safety continues to be a concern at the airport. On Friday, air traffic controllers had to separate a departing Delta flight and four Air Force jets after they flew too close to one another, setting off a traffic collision avoidance alert in the passenger plane. The National Transportation Safety Board and F.A.A. are investigating the episode. Mark Walker is an investigative reporter focused on transportation. He is based in Washington.

"Lawyers for Venezuelan migrants asked the justices to keep in place a pause on President Trump’s deportation plan, calling it “completely at odds” with limited wartime authority given by Congress.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Lawyers for Venezuelan migrants asked the justices to keep in place a pause on President Trump’s deportation plan, calling it “completely at odds” with limited wartime authority given by Congress. By Abbie VanSickle Reporting from Washington Lawyers for Venezuelan migrants accused of being members of a violent street gang asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to continue a temporary block on President Trump’s use of a wartime powers law to send hundreds of people to a prison in El Salvador. The Trump administration has asked the justices to intervene and lift a block on the deportations imposed by a lower court. But a brief filed on behalf of the immigrants by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward said that block is now “the only thing” preventing the Trump administration from sending immigrants “to a prison in El Salvador, perhaps never to be seen again, without any kind of procedural protection, much less judicial review.” The government has already sent more than 130 Venezuelan men from the United States to El Salvador, according to the court filing, where the migrants “have been confined, incommunicado, in one of most brutal prisons in the world, where torture and other human rights abuses are rampant.” The legal battle over the deportations of the Venezuelan migrants is one of the first major tests of Mr. Trump’s flurry of executive orders to reach the high court. It is perhaps the most high-profile of the eight emergency applications filed by the administration, focusing squarely on a collision between the judicial and executive branches. There are typically no hearings or oral arguments for cases on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, and there is no public schedule for a decision. The 514-page filing, which included documents from the lower court and declarations from human rights experts, marks the latest turn in the legal fight over Mr. Trump’s efforts to remove immigrants accused of being members of Tren de Aragua, a street gang with roots in Venezuela’s northern Aragua state.

"The speaker tried to use an unprecedented parliamentary maneuver to deny a bipartisan majority the chance to hold a vote on their proposal to allow new parents to vote remotely in the House.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The speaker tried to use an unprecedented parliamentary maneuver to deny a bipartisan majority the chance to hold a vote on their proposal to allow new parents to vote remotely in the House. By Annie Karni Reporting from the Capitol Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday tried and failed to kill a bipartisan effort to change House rules so that lawmakers would temporarily be allowed to vote remotely after the birth of a child, suffering an embarrassing defeat that paralyzed the chamber and signaled that the proposal could soon be adopted. Using strong-arm tactics in a bid to block the measure, Mr. Johnson tried an extraordinary use of the speaker’s power to prevent the House from even considering a measure backed by half its members. But nine Republicans refused to go along, instead dealing him a public rebuke that left him without a strategy for moving ahead. After the vote, Mr. Johnson abruptly canceled votes for the rest of the week, sending members home and leaving legislative business unsettled. Under House rules, Republican leaders are required to bring the proxy voting resolution to a vote within two legislative days. But they appeared to be refusing to do anything else until the holdouts in their party cave, which they have shown no sign of doing. As Republicans left Washington for the week having passed no bills, it was not clear how or when the issue would be resolved. The showdown on the House floor was a capstone of a long-running fight over the rights of new parents in Congress. It began over a year ago, when Representative Anna Paulina Luna, Republican of Florida, began agitating for a change to House rules that would allow new mothers to designate a colleague to vote by proxy on their behalf for up to six weeks after giving birth. Ms. Luna landed on the idea after her own child was born. Nine Republicans joined Democrats to force a vote to allow members who had new children to vote by proxy.

"Civil rights advocates say Canary Mission is doxxing critics of Israel and providing a possible road map for immigration agents as they sweep up students in a campus crackdown.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Civil rights advocates say Canary Mission is doxxing critics of Israel and providing a possible road map for immigration agents as they sweep up students in a campus crackdown. By Stephanie Saul On March 24, a shadowy group that calls itself Canary Mission posted a new feature on its website, “Uncovering Foreign Nationals,” in response to President Trump’s recent executive order on combating antisemitism. The group, which says its mission is to single out those who promote “hatred of the U.S.A., Israel and Jews on North American college campuses,” listed the names of seven students and academics, including three current and former professors at Columbia University. The seven people whom Canary Mission flagged, all of whom the group says could be deported because they are not U.S. citizens, are among thousands of people whose pictures, along with details of their alleged antisemitic activities, have been posted on Canary’s website since its creation a decade ago — all accused of anti-Israeli activism. Since the Trump administration began targeting students in a sweeping immigration crackdown last month, nine students and professors, several of whom had engaged in protests or other activism over Israel’s war in Gaza, have been either threatened with deportation or detained. Three of them had appeared on the Canary Mission website. The actions taken in recent weeks against these foreign students and academics, many of them highly accomplished in their fields, have raised questions about why federal authorities are singling them out, and what role outside groups like Canary Mission are playing in identifying targets for deportation. In a briefing on Monday, a State Department spokeswoman, asked about whether such lists played a role in decision-making, said the agency would not discuss “what happens with individuals and visas, and whether they’re issued or if they’re revoked.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Mohammad Rahim Wahidi, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, was detained for more than 30 hours upon returning to the country over the weekend.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Mohammad Rahim Wahidi, a lawful permanent resident of the United States, was detained for more than 30 hours upon returning to the country over the weekend. By Zach Montague Reporting from Washington The Taliban’s former ambassador to Spain was detained by U.S. immigration officials while entering the United States on Saturday, and remained in custody after a federal judge declined to order his release on Monday. The former Afghan diplomat, Mohammad Rahim Wahidi, was detained at Washington Dulles International Airport under what his lawyer described as a weaponization of part of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Under the law, the secretary of state can deport a noncitizen determined to be a national security risk. Mr. Wahidi is a lawful permanent resident and his wife, Mary Shakeri-Wahidi, is a U.S. citizen, according to a court filing from his lawyer, Hassan Ahmad. The Trump administration has recently cited similar legal justifications for canceling the visas of hundreds of students whose participation in pro-Palestinian demonstrations has appeared to become grounds for detention and deportation. In targeting student activists such as Mahmoud Khalil, Rumeysa Ozturk and Momodou Taal for deportation, the administration has tried to link their protests against Israel to “adverse foreign policy consequences” that would justify their removal. Mr. Wahidi’s case appears to be different. According to the filing asking for his release, Mr. Wahidi’s brother-in-law is wanted by the United States in connection with a plot to assassinate an Iranian journalist that the Justice Department detailed in a news release in November. Mr. Wahidi was stripped of his title in Spain over accusations of sexual assault during his time there, but criminal charges were never filed against him and he was allowed to leave the country, according to the filing. Upon returning to the United States on a Turkish Airlines flight on Saturday, Mr. Wahidi was detained for more than 30 hours without access to a lawyer, according to the filing. He was then interrogated by “an unclear number of officers” who appeared to be from the F.B.I., Mr. Ahmad wrote in the petition. Mr. Ahmad has also represented Badar Khan Suri, a postdoctoral student at Georgetown University who was targeted for deportation over his involvement in campus protests there. After Mr. Wahidi’s petition was filed, Judge Leonie Brinkema of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia blocked the government from transferring Mr. Wahidi out of the area. In cases involving the student activists, people have routinely been moved to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers in Louisiana, hundreds of miles from where they were initially arrested. Neither Mr. Ahmad nor a spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection responded to requests for comment. Judge Brinkema declined to immediately order Mr. Wahidi’s release, saying that “at this point the court cannot offer any relief.” While the case proceeds, she ordered the government to “comply with C.B.P. short-term detention standards” and not to restrict Mr. Wahidi from speaking to a lawyer. Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.

Republicans embraced him.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Signal Leaks Advertisement Supported by Democrats seemed to view Lt. Gen. Dan Caine as perhaps the best possible option, under the circumstances. Republicans embraced him. By Helene Cooper Reporting from Washington The confirmation hearing on Tuesday for Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, President Trump’s pick to lead the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was strikingly uncontentious. While the hearings for many other Trump nominees have been heated, General Caine’s was relatively smooth. Democrats lodged their displeasure that Mr. Trump fired Gen. Charles Q. Brown, his last Joint Chiefs chairman, but seemed to indicate they viewed General Caine as perhaps the best possible option, under the circumstances. Republicans praised him. Here are key takeaways from the hearing. General Caine appears to have enough support to be approved by the Armed Services Committee and confirmed by the Senate. He will almost certainly outperform Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in votes for confirmation. Mr. Hegseth needed the intervention of Vice President JD Vance to cast the deciding vote, making him defense secretary by a one-vote margin. Throughout General Caine’s hearing, Democrats appeared to be caught between a rock and a hard place. They wanted him to say plainly that he would push back against some of Mr. Hegseth’s initiatives targeting ethnic minorities, women and other groups. But they did not want to push so hard that they irreparably harmed his relationships with Mr. Hegseth and Mr. Trump before he even takes office. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Adam Goldman Reporting from Washington Dan Bongino, the F.B.I.’s deputy director, who rose to popularity as a conservative podcaster bashing Democrats and praising President Trump, sought to reassure the bureau’s employees that he would not act as a “partisan political figure.” Addressing the work force on Monday, Mr. Bongino said in an email that he would set “aside any personal politics” and rise above partisanship in stepping into the crucial job of overseeing 38,000 employees. “That’s what I did as a special agent with the U.S. Secret Service, where I proudly protected both Democratic and Republican presidents,” he added. “And it’s what I did as an officer with the N.Y.P.D., where I served and protected all the people of New York City equally.” The message was a striking admission for any F.B.I. official — let alone the No. 2 in the organization. It reflected existing skepticism among former and current agents about whether Mr. Bongino and Kash Patel, the director, will maintain the bureau’s fierce independence in the face of investigations that could anger the White House. Mr. Patel, a former prosecutor for the Justice Department, was also a high-profile surrogate for the Trump campaign. In years past, deputy directors have been veteran agents in the bureau, climbing the ranks until landing on the seventh floor of F.B.I. headquarters in Washington. That period gives agents a chance to learn how to make cases, run major operations and field offices and deal with national security crises. They also fight for agents who face resistance from prosecutors. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"A canvasser for the billionaire’s America PAC says he’s owed $20,000 for signatures he collected on a petition that was part of Mr. Musk’s effort to motivate Trump voters.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by A canvasser for the billionaire’s America PAC says he’s owed $20,000 for signatures he collected on a petition that was part of Mr. Musk’s effort to motivate Trump voters. By Kate Conger During the height of the 2024 presidential campaign, Elon Musk promised Pennsylvanians a $100 reward for signing a petition in support of free speech and gun ownership rights. The billionaire also offered $47 to anyone who recruited a signatory to the petition — and increased the payment to $100 as Election Day drew near. Now, a canvasser for Mr. Musk’s America PAC who gathered signatures in Pennsylvania is suing the executive, saying Mr. Musk failed to pay him for $20,000 worth of signatures. The worker, who filed suit Tuesday as a John Doe for privacy reasons, accused Mr. Musk of breach of contracts and failing to deliver on his promises to pay by Nov. 30. The lawsuit, filed as a class action against Mr. Musk and his super PAC in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, would allow plaintiffs who signed the petition or gathered signatures from others to seek payment. Several other workers for Mr. Musk’s PAC may join the suit, according to the filing. Mr. Musk and a lawyer who represents his super PAC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. America PAC says on its website that it has paid the majority of people who signed its Pennsylvania petition. “Consistent with the November 30 payment goal that we set for ourselves, America PAC has already mailed the overwhelming majority of checks owed to eligible referrers and petition signers,” the super PAC’s frequently asked questions page says. “If you haven’t received payment yet, that does not necessarily mean you won’t.” Mr. Musk’s petition payment promises were part of a broader strategy to flex his wealth heading into Election Day. In the campaign’s final days, he ramped up the effort by promising to enter signers in a daily $1 million giveaway. Philadelphia’s district attorney challenged the giveaway, calling it an illegal lottery, but a judge allowed it to continue after Mr. Musk’s team argued that the winners were not selected by chance, but based in part on their personal story and “suitability” to be paid. Mr. Musk has continued to use his wealth to incentivize voters to support conservative causes. During a visit to Wisconsin on Sunday, Mr. Musk handed out two checks for $1 million to local voters who signed a petition supporting a conservative candidate for the state’s Supreme Court. (For 12 hours, Mr. Musk floated a questionable plan to open the sweepstakes only to Wisconsin residents who had already voted, but backtracked in the face of legal scrutiny.)

By Simon J. Levien A 7-year-old girl was struck and killed on Saturday by a falling boulder at a Lake Tahoe-area ski resort in Incline Village, Nev., the authorities said. Medical aid was called at around 3:38 p.m. to the Diamond Peak Ski Resort where staff members began administering first aid before help arrived, according to a statement from the resort on Monday. The child, whom the Washoe County Regional Medical Examiner’s Office identified on Monday as Adelyn Grimes, died at the scene from her injuries. The Washoe County Sheriff’s Office and the North Lake Tahoe Fire Protection District responded to the call on Saturday. The Diamond Peak resort said that the child was not skiing at the time of the accident. “The entire Diamond Peak Ski Resort family has been deeply affected” by the tragedy at the resort, it said. The sheriff’s office said it had conducted an initial investigation and determined that there was no foul play involved in the child’s death, but that the case had not been closed. Some were rallying around the girl’s family. “Addie was a shining star who brought immense joy and laughter to those who knew her,” read a page on Meal Train, a website where people can organize meals for loved ones, and which was apparently set up for Adelyn’s parents and brother.

"The world’s richest man misstated a statistic from the Social Security Administration to once again overstate fraud in the program.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Fact Check The world’s richest man misstated a statistic from the Social Security Administration to once again overstate fraud in the program. By Linda Qiu Reporting from Washington Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has continued his campaign to aggressively undercut Social Security, leveling baseless and often misleading attacks on the insurance program. During an event in Wisconsin on Sunday for a state judicial race, Mr. Musk, who has made inaccurate and unsupported claims about dead people and unauthorized immigrants receiving benefits and broad allegations of widespread fraud, took aim at phone calls to the Social Security Administration. It is part of Mr. Musk’s broader bid to identify what he deems waste and abuse across the federal government, and the entitlement program has been in his cross hairs in recent weeks. The cost-cutting initiative Mr. Musk leads, the Department of Government Efficiency, did not respond to requests for comment. What Was Said “One interesting statistic was that 40 percent of the calls into Social Security were fraudulent, meaning that it was someone trying to get a Social Security payment that was going to a senior instead to go to a fraud ring.”
— during a campaign event in Wisconsin on Sunday This is misleading. Mr. Musk appears to have misunderstood a statistic from the Social Security Administration. The agency recently estimated that 40 percent of direct deposit fraud, one specific type of fraud, occurred via calls to the agency. That is not the same thing as 40 percent of all telephone calls being fraudulent. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"Former federal employees went to a Capitol Hill basement to find the lawmakers. Democratic senators said that they would keep fighting as hard as they could. Most Republicans ignored the workers.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Former federal employees went to a Capitol Hill basement to find the lawmakers. Democratic senators said that they would keep fighting as hard as they could. Most Republicans ignored the workers. By Maya C. Miller Reporting from Capitol Hill Terminated federal workers have been organizing weekly protests inside the Capitol to share their stories and ask senators to defend them and the work they do on behalf of the American people. On Tuesday, more than a dozen federal employees and contractors — some recently fired and others put on administrative leave — called out to senators in the basement of the Dirksen Senate Office Building as the lawmakers hustled to catch an underground electric train to the Capitol. The grass-roots lobbying effort on Capitol Hill, which started in late February and has ballooned over the last several weeks, is the latest attempt by civil servants to push back as the Trump administration and Elon Musk work to cull the ranks of the federal work force. Among the fired workers at the Dirksen Building on Tuesday was Lexi Smith, a health communications researcher with the Food and Drug Administration, who learned at 5 a.m. that she would lose her job as part of mass layoffs within the Department of Health and Human Services. Her team, which was largely dismantled on Tuesday, was responsible for telling the public about any changes to a drug’s safety information, such as when a label is updated with newly identified risks or side effects. “I came here because I don’t know what else to do,” said Ms. Smith, who lives in Washington. She learned about the protest from a colleague, who heard about it through a Signal group. “It doesn’t feel like anyone is going to stand up, and so I’m going to come tell my story to stand up for myself.” The senators’ reactions were largely divided along party lines. Most Democrats who walked by the group stopped to listen, share encouragement and thank the workers for their service. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Jonathan Braun, who has had a string of legal issues since President Trump commuted his drug sentence four years ago, was arrested after allegedly punching an acquaintance and shoving a 3-year-old.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Jonathan Braun, who has had a string of legal issues since President Trump commuted his drug sentence four years ago, was arrested after allegedly punching an acquaintance and shoving a 3-year-old. By Michael S. Schmidt Jonathan Braun has repeatedly been in legal trouble since President Trump commuted his federal prison sentence more than four years ago as part of a rushed, last-minute process of granting clemency to allies and well-connected special pleaders before leaving office. On Saturday, Mr. Braun, a major player in the predatory lending business, was arrested on Long Island on charges of assaulting an acquaintance and his 3-year-old child, according to court documents. It was the fourth time he has been arrested since Mr. Trump freed him. Mr. Braun punched the man in the face and then shoved the child to the ground, “causing a red mark on his back and substantial pain” to the child’s back, the documents said. Mr. Braun was charged with assault, endangering the welfare of a child and injuring a child under the age of 7. He was released on bail Monday. Robert Caliendo, a lawyer for Mr. Braun, did not respond to messages seeking comment. In his final hours in office in early 2021, Mr. Trump commuted Mr. Braun’s 10-year sentence for running a marijuana smuggling ring. Mr. Braun’s family used a connection to Charles Kushner, the father of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law who served as a senior White House adviser, to try to get the matter before Mr. Trump. Jared Kushner’s White House office drafted the language used to announce commutations for Mr. Braun and others. Since then, Mr. Braun returned to predatory lending only to be banned from operating in that business by a New York State judge and a federal judge for engaging in deceptive practices. And he has been accused of a number of crimes: punching his wife and father-in-law in the head; grabbing a nanny’s breast while touching himself; trying to assault a female nurse with poles used to hold intravenous bags; and threatening a synagogue congregant who asked him to be quiet during services.

By Mark Walker Reporting from Washington The U.S. Transportation Department is giving employees a second opportunity to voluntarily resign as part of the Trump administration’s continued efforts to downsize the government work force. In an email to staff Tuesday morning, the agency said workers had until April 7 to accept the “strictly voluntary” buyout offer under the deferred resignation program. Employees who choose to participate will continue receiving their salaries through Sept. 30 without being required to report to work, according to the email workers received. Participants are also protected from being terminated through an “involuntary separation, such as reduction in force.” Positions the agency has deemed critical for safety — including air traffic controllers, railroad safety inspectors and motor carrier safety specialists — are excluded from the offer. An agency spokeswoman said there was no specific target for the reduction in the number of employees the buyouts were expected to achieve. The department is offering the second wave of buyouts to accommodate employees who may have declined the initial offer because of the confusion and the disruption surrounding the first round, the agency spokeswoman said. “This is just one part of our effort to make D.O.T. more efficient and accountable to the taxpayer,” the spokeswoman said in a statement. Workers at other federal agencies are also facing efforts to further reduce their work force. Thousands of people with the Department of Health and Human Services received layoff notices starting at 5 a.m. Tuesday morning. Since the first round of deferred resignations concluded, agencies have started a series of layoffs and terminations that have led to tens of thousands of job cuts. It’s unclear how many Transportation Department workers took the voluntary buyout when it was first offered. The dismissals have been carried out in coordination with the Department of Government Efficiency led by Elon Musk and have set off several lawsuits that remain pending in the courts. Mark Walker is an investigative reporter focused on transportation. He is based in Washington.

Biden Jr.’s family and former White House officials about clemency.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by In an unorthodox move, Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney in Washington, is questioning former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s family and former White House officials about clemency. By Kenneth P. Vogel Kenneth P. Vogel has reported extensively on presidential clemency. Ed Martin, the ardent Trump loyalist serving as interim U.S. attorney in Washington, is pursuing an inquiry into whether former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was competent to pardon his family members and others during his final days in office. The inquiry, which includes previously unreported letters to Mr. Biden’s family and former White House staff members, uses the levers of federal law enforcement to try to harass Mr. Biden’s family and allies and undermine his decisions as president, while scoring political points with President Trump. Mr. Trump and his supporters have increasingly seized on the unsubstantiated theory that the pardons Mr. Biden issued during his final months in office may be invalid because he lacked the mental capacity to consent to them. In an apparent effort to build the case, Mr. Martin began sending letters two months ago to Mr. Biden’s White House aides, including Jeffrey D. Zients, the former chief of staff, as well as recipients of Mr. Biden’s pardons, such as his brother James Biden and sister-in-law Sara Biden, according to three people familiar with the effort who were not authorized to discuss it publicly, and a copy of a letter obtained by The New York Times. The letters, signed by Mr. Martin, are informal but provocative, questioning a presidential clemency power that has generally gone unchallenged. They highlight Mr. Martin’s hands-on approach and willingness to use one of the most important U.S. attorneys’ offices in the country to seek retribution against Mr. Trump’s perceived enemies.

By Emily Cochrane Reporting from Ormond Beach, Fla. Two Trump-backed Republicans won special congressional elections in Florida on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press, shoring up their party’s slim majority in the House at a crucial moment for President Trump’s domestic agenda. Jimmy Patronis, the state’s chief financial officer, won the race to replace Matt Gaetz in the First Congressional District, on the western end of the Panhandle. With most of the vote counted late Tuesday, Mr. Patronis had won 57 percent. And State Senator Randy Fine captured the Sixth District seat that had been held by Michael Waltz, now Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. That district is rooted in Daytona Beach and parts of the northeast coast. Mr. Fine had 56.7 percent of the vote as of 9 p.m. Both seats had been expected to remain in Republican hands, though some private polls showed Mr. Fine facing a close contest against Josh Weil, his Democratic opponent.

"The cracks in support show how seriously some conservatives are taking the administration’s aggressive and at times slapdash tactics.",2025-04-01,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The cracks in support show how seriously some conservatives are taking the administration’s aggressive and at times slapdash tactics. By Luke Broadwater Reporting from Washington Influential figures on the right have largely cheered on the opening months of the Trump presidency. But as the administration has rushed to carry out deportations as quickly as possible, making mistakes and raising concerns about due process along the way, the unified front in favor of President Trump’s immigration purge is beginning to crack. When the administration deported a professional makeup artist and accused him of being part of a criminal gang, the enormously popular podcaster Joe Rogan balked. “You’ve got to get scared that people who are not criminals are getting lassoed up and deported and sent to El Salvador prisons,” Mr. Rogan, who endorsed Mr. Trump, said on his show “The Joe Rogan Experience.” He added that the case was “horrific.” When the administration arrested a former Columbia University graduate student who had been involved in campus protests, the far-right commentator Ann Coulter questioned the move. “There’s almost no one I don’t want to deport, but unless they’ve committed a crime, isn’t this a violation of the First Amendment?” Ms. Coulter wrote on social media. The dissenting voices, which have been limited mostly to commentators rather than elected Republicans, are remarkable because conservatives don’t often openly break with the president. And while the objections have largely been contained to tactics — not the overarching goal of ramping up deportations — the cracks show how seriously some conservatives are taking the administration’s aggressive and at times slapdash methods.

"California Democrats rejected two Republican bills that would have banned transgender athletes from female sports. In a rare turn, Republicans tried to use the Democratic governor’s own words to challenge Democrats.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by California Democrats rejected two Republican bills that would have banned transgender athletes from female sports. In a rare turn, Republicans tried to use the Democratic governor’s own words to challenge Democrats. By Laurel Rosenhall Reporting from Sacramento It was a discussion of a kind rarely, if ever, seen in the California State Capitol. For hours on Tuesday, Republicans repeatedly invoked the views of Gov. Gavin Newsom, while the governor’s fellow Democrats took pains to avoid saying his name. At issue were two Republican bills that would have banned transgender athletes from female sports, just days after Mr. Newsom had reiterated his personal belief that their participation was unfair to those who were born as girls. “For the first time ever, Gavin Newsom and I agree,” said Karen England, executive director of the Capitol Resource Institute, a conservative advocacy group. Democrats, who control the Assembly Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports and Tourism, ultimately quashed the bills after dozens of people spoke in a packed hearing room. The debate brought into stark focus an extraordinary rift among California Democrats on the issue of transgender participation in female sports. Mr. Newsom, a longtime supporter of expanding L.G.B.T.Q. rights, publicly broke with his party last month when he said on his new podcast that he thinks it’s “deeply unfair” for transgender athletes to compete in female sports. The governor repeated that position Friday during an interview on “Real Time With Bill Maher,” in which he also said the Democratic Party brand is “toxic.” Mr. Newsom has not publicly weighed in on the transgender sports bills, and his office declined to comment on Tuesday. But his recent comments have scrambled the conventional coalitions in California’s Capitol, where Democrats hold a supermajority in the Legislature and occupy every statewide office. While it is common for Democrats to split on bills concerning the environment, economy, crime or education, divisions over L.G.B.T.Q. rights are rare.

"Another round of “deferred resignation” offers is part of the Trump administration’s stepped-up effort to rapidly downsize the government.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Federal Layoffs Advertisement Supported by Another round of “deferred resignation” offers is part of the Trump administration’s stepped-up effort to rapidly downsize the government. By Eileen Sullivan Eileen Sullivan, reporting from Washington, covers changes to the federal work force under the Trump administration. Federal agencies have accelerated their efforts to cut thousands of jobs, offering buyouts and eliminating entire offices as the Trump administration’s deadline to downsize approaches. At least six federal agencies have in recent days extended a “deferred resignation” offer that was originally pitched to government workers in January as a one-time opportunity that would allow employees to resign but continue to be paid for a period of time. The latest offer was sent to employees at the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Housing and Urban Development and Transportation, as well as the General Services Administration, according to emails received by workers at those agencies reviewed by The New York Times. Employees at those agencies have to make their decisions between Monday, April 7, and April 11, depending on the agency, the emails said. President Trump and his top adviser on downsizing the government, Elon Musk, have ordered nearly every agency to reduce staff on a tight deadline to overhaul the government, in part by eliminating programs the president views as ideologically objectionable. Mr. Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency have promised significant savings to American taxpayers as a result, though wages and benefits for the federal work force amount to just 4.3 percent of the $6.3 trillion federal budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Mr. Trump has given Mr. Musk wide latitude to effect change, empowering him to effectively shutter agencies. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The state has required voters to use photograph identification for nearly a decade, but an amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution was seen as making it more difficult to roll back that rule.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The state has required voters to use photograph identification for nearly a decade, but an amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution was seen as making it more difficult to roll back that rule. By Julie Bosman Wisconsin voters on Tuesday approved an amendment to the State Constitution to strengthen a current law requiring photo identification at the polls, The Associated Press said, a victory for Republicans who sponsored the effort.  For close to a decade, state law has required the use of photo ID when voting at the polls in Wisconsin. But a constitutional amendment was seen as making it far more difficult to roll back the voter ID law, even under a state Supreme Court with a liberal majority or if the State Legislature fell under Democratic control. The measure was brought by Republicans, who control a majority of seats in the State Legislature and had pressed for the amendment for years. Conservatives have steadily and successfully pushed for stricter voter ID laws across the country, suggesting that they are needed to combat widespread voter fraud. Election experts say that voter fraud in American elections is exceedingly rare. Democratic leaders opposed the effort for the amendment in Wisconsin, arguing that it would disenfranchise voters including students, older people and particularly Black voters, who studies have shown are less likely to carry photo identification than white voters. While Black voters make up only about 5 percent of Wisconsin’s electorate, they overwhelmingly favor Democratic candidates. Democrats also questioned why the amendment should be a priority at all, saying that Republicans were neglecting more pressing matters facing the state such as affordable child care, public education and gun control. Last week, President Trump stepped into the fray on voter ID requirements, issuing an executive order seeking to require documentary proof of citizenship to vote. Democrats responded with a lawsuit on Monday, arguing that the president’s order was unconstitutional and that he has no explicit authority to regulate elections. Thirty-six states ask for or require voters to show some form of identification at the polls, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan group. Polls show that voter ID laws enjoy broad bipartisan support, with a Pew Research survey conducted in January finding that 81 percent of voters agree with a requirement that all voters should show government-issued identification to cast ballots. Wisconsin voters also strongly support voter ID laws, according to polls in recent years. A 2021 survey by the Marquette University Law School showed that 92 percent of Republicans and 55 percent of Democrats favored requiring photo ID to vote. Julie Bosman is the Chicago bureau chief for The Times, writing and reporting stories from around the Midwest.

"Susan Crawford defeated Brad Schimel for a State Supreme Court seat in a race that shattered spending records and maintained a liberal majority on the court.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Elections Advertisement Supported by Susan Crawford defeated Brad Schimel for a State Supreme Court seat in a race that shattered spending records and maintained a liberal majority on the court. transcript Susan! Susan! Susan! Susan! As a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world – for justice in Wisconsin, and we won. My promise to Wisconsin is clear. I will be a fair, impartial and commonsense justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. And Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price. Our courts are not for sale. By Reid J. Epstein Reid J. Epstein has reported on Wisconsin politics on and off since 2002. He reported from Madison, Wis. A liberal candidate for a pivotal seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court overcame $25 million in spending from Elon Musk and defeated her conservative opponent on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported, in a contest that became a kind of referendum on Mr. Musk and his slashing of the federal government. With turnout extraordinarily high for a spring election in an off year, Judge Susan Crawford handily beat Judge Brad Schimel, who ran on his loyalty to President Trump and was aided by Mr. Musk, the president’s billionaire policy aide. Mr. Musk not only poured money into the race but also campaigned personally in the state, even donning a cheesehead. But his starring role seemed to inflame Democratic anger against him even more than it helped Judge Schimel. The barrage of spending in the race may nearly double the previous record for a single judicial election. With about 95 percent of the vote counted on Tuesday evening, Judge Crawford held a lead of roughly 9 points. “Today, Wisconsinites fended off an unprecedented attack on our democracy, our fair elections and our Supreme Court,” she said in her victory speech on Tuesday night. “Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price. Our courts are not for sale.” For Democrats, the result is a jolt of momentum. They have been engaged in a coast-to-coast rhetorical rending of garments since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January and embarked with Mr. Musk on an effort to drastically shrink federal agencies, set aside international alliances and alter the government’s relationships with the nation’s universities, minority groups, immigrants and corporate world.

A federal judge in Maryland on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to stop firing probationary employees who live or work in 19 states and the District of Columbia while a legal challenge to the mass terminations makes its way through the courts. In his order, Judge James K. Bredar, of the Federal District Court in Maryland, narrowed the scope of an earlier, temporary pause that applied nationwide and led to the reinstatement of nearly 24,000 federal probationary employees fired in February. It was not immediately clear how many of those employees would no longer be covered by Tuesday’s order and therefore at risk of being fired again. The uncertainty around what Judge Bredar’s order means for some of these reinstated employees is the latest example of the chaos caused by the Trump administration’s move to fire workers with probationary status en masse. Officials targeted probationary employees because they have fewer civil service protections than workers who have been in their positions longer. Their layoffs were the first major actions taken to enact President Trump’s plans to gut the federal work force. Last month, 19 states and the District of Columbia sued the federal government over the mass firings, arguing that the actions amounted to a reduction in force, a formal reorganization process that demands the government follow specific steps. One such step is that the government must give states a heads-up whenever it plans to fire 50 employees in a certain area. The states argued that without these notifications, they were left to face spikes in unemployment without warning. While the states argued that a pause in firings should be nationwide, Judge Bredar said he chose to apply it only to those who live or work in the jurisdictions that sued, wary of criticisms of district judges who issue nationwide orders to curb executive branch actions. The Trump administration appealed the previous temporary order, and is likely to appeal the longer-term injunction issued on Tuesday. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Reid J. EpsteinJulie Bosman and Emily Cochrane Elon Musk’s money can buy him love from Republicans, but not, it turns out, a Wisconsin Supreme Court election. A campaign awash in more than $25 million in spending by the world’s richest man and groups tied to him ended up much like the other elections of the first months of President Trump’s second term: with a surge of energy from Democratic Wisconsin voters that overwhelmed whatever turnout Republicans could manage in response. On the same night that Judge Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate, was delivering a thumping to Judge Brad Schimel, the Trump-backed conservative, Democrats saw a silver lining in losses in two special congressional elections in Florida. In both races, they were able to cut sharply into the much wider Republican victory margins from November. In all, the night’s results demonstrated what Democratic officials have been saying in recent weeks: that their voters are fired up to fight back against a Trump administration set on tearing down large chunks of the federal government. “Democracy is alive and roaring in the Badger State,” said Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. “In a moment of national darkness, Wisconsin voters lit a candle.

"T. Elliot Gaiser will be nominated to lead the influential Office of Legal Counsel, a department official said.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by T. Elliot Gaiser will be nominated to lead the influential Office of Legal Counsel, a department official said. By Charlie Savage Reporting from Washington President Trump intends to nominate T. Elliot Gaiser, the conservative solicitor general of Ohio, to be the assistant attorney general leading the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, according to a Justice Department official. That position has traditionally often had the final say on legal debates within the executive branch. The Office of Legal Counsel issues authoritative interpretations of the law for the executive branch through courtlike opinions. Its view of what the law permits is binding on other agencies and officials unless the attorney general overrides the office or the president opts not to take its advice. The office was at the center of many legal and policy fights during Mr. Trump’s first administration. Led by the Trump appointee Steven Engel, it signed off on the ordering of the targeted killing of a top Iranian official and the Treasury Department’s withholding of Mr. Trump’s tax returns from Congress. Mr. Gaiser, whose selection as the forthcoming nominee was provided by the official on condition of anonymity to discuss a matter that has not yet been announced, has a strong conservative legal résumé. He clerked for Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. during the Supreme Court’s 2021-2 term, when Justice Alito wrote the majority opinion overruling the Roe v. Wade abortion rights precedent. Mr. Gaiser had previously served two clerkship years with prominent conservative appellate court judges, Judge Neomi Rao of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Judge Edith H. Jones of the Fifth Circuit, alternating with short stints at law firms. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"Óscar Arias Sánchez, twice president of Costa Rica, has been a vocal critic of President Trump, describing him as acting like a “Roman emperor.”",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Óscar Arias Sánchez, twice president of Costa Rica, has been a vocal critic of President Trump, describing him as acting like a “Roman emperor.” By Yan Zhuang Óscar Arias Sánchez, the Nobel laureate and former Costa Rican president, said on Tuesday that the United States had revoked his visa to enter the country, with no reason given. A vocal critic of President Trump, Mr. Arias appears to be the most high profile in a string of individuals who have had their visas canceled or been denied entry as the Trump administration bars people who it says have “hostile attitudes” toward the United States. Mr. Arias, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for brokering a plan to end the civil wars in Central America, said he had received a short email from the U.S. government informing him that his visa had been revoked. At a news conference in San José, the capital of Costa Rica, he said that the email, which he received Tuesday morning, cited Section 221(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the secretary of state and consular officials to revoke visas at their discretion. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did the Costa Rican government. “I don’t know why they have revoked my visa,” Mr. Arias said at the news conference. “I don’t know if the revoking of my visa is some sort of punishment, because I say what I think.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The party’s position remains dire. But a judicial victory in Wisconsin and closer-than-expected losses in Florida suggest a once-demoralized Democratic base is animated again.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Elections Advertisement Supported by news analysis The party’s position remains dire. But a judicial victory in Wisconsin and closer-than-expected losses in Florida suggest a once-demoralized Democratic base is animated again. By Katie Glueck Democrats this week achieved their biggest gains to date in the second Trump era, winning a fiercely contested State Supreme Court race in Wisconsin, while also landing relatively strong showings despite losing two Florida special elections. For a demoralized party, maybe, just maybe, it’s a start. The results on Tuesday do not erase the long list of harsh realities for Democrats, who remain locked out of power in President Trump’s Washington and severely limited in their efforts to constrain him. Their party’s popularity is at a generational low, activists are furious with their leaders, and, as Democrats have learned the hard way, victories in obscure and off-year races do not always translate into national success. But winning is better than losing, and Democrats have indeed been doing some significant winning. At minimum, the Wisconsin results are a stinging rebuke to Elon Musk, the billionaire and top Trump adviser who spent millions in Wisconsin in support of the conservative candidate. The outcomes made clear that a once-demoralized Democratic base is animated again, on the same night that Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey delighted the party by completing the longest Senate speech on record, a 25-hour tirade and cri de coeur against the president and his administration. And a substantial victory for the liberal candidate in Wisconsin — a state Mr. Trump won in November, where races are often nail-biters — instantly reverberated nationally.

Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas is currently serving his third term.Credit...Desiree Rios for The New York Times Supported by By J. David Goodman Reporting from Dallas Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, is getting ready to challenge Senator John Cornyn in what could be the nastiest and most expensive Republican Party showdown of the 2026 election. In an interview on Tuesday in Dallas, Mr. Paxton tiptoed close to declaring himself a candidate, offering up the kind of legislation he would first propose if elected to the Senate — tax cuts — and describing why he felt he could do more in Washington, D.C., than in Texas. “I just think there’s a lot of things that you could do at the federal level,” Mr. Paxton said. “Trump can use the help and have a senator that actually is supportive and not critical.” Asked how he made his decision to run, Mr. Paxton began answering the question. Then he was reminded by a campaign consultant that he had not yet officially decided to run. “Right,” Mr. Paxton said. The likelihood of a primary between Mr. Paxton and Mr. Cornyn has been growing in recent months. It would be perhaps the biggest electoral face-off yet in the ongoing war between the Texas Republican Party’s old guard and an ascendant wing of hard-right social conservatives aligned with Mr. Paxton and President Trump. The looming clash has been among the worst kept secrets in Texas politics. “Good luck with your primary, John,” posted Colin Allred, a former Democratic representative in Dallas who unsuccessfully challenged Senator Ted Cruz last year and has said he is considering entering the 2026 Senate race.

"The order for the funds’ temporary restoration came after nonprofit groups challenged the government’s decision to cut funding for legal services for unaccompanied children arriving in the United States.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The order for the funds’ temporary restoration came after nonprofit groups challenged the government’s decision to cut funding for legal services for unaccompanied children arriving in the United States. By Isabella Kwai A federal judge in Northern California ordered the restoration of legal funds for migrant children who enter the United States alone, temporarily reversing a Trump administration decision last month that had left children at risk of deportation. Nonprofit groups had been fighting the decision since they received notice from the federal government on March 21 that it would terminate funding for legal services for unaccompanied children in immigration court. The halt in funding, according to a complaint filed by the groups, had put some 26,000 children at risk of being cut off from their lawyers and disadvantaged them in adversarial immigration proceedings. The government had argued that the funding was discretionary and that it was not obligated to provide legal representation for the children. But Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín of San Francisco disagreed, saying on Tuesday that by terminating the funding, the government had potentially violated its obligations to protect children from human trafficking. Under a law combating human trafficking, which the nonprofit groups argued the government had violated, the government must, to the “greatest extent practicable,” provide legal representation to minors. Children represented by the nonprofits, according to the groups’ complaint, arrived in the United States to flee violence, poverty and other dangers. Many of them are from Central America. Most do not speak English or have the means to hire a lawyer. Nearly two-thirds of unaccompanied children had representation when they appeared in U.S. courts during the 2024 fiscal year, according to official data. Children who have lawyers attend their hearings 95 percent of the time, while those without representation attend only 33 percent of the time. Thousands of children in recent years who have missed their court dates have been ordered to be deported. Since the federal funding was cut off, the groups said that they had been forced to consider cutting staff to stay financially viable or to stop providing legal services to existing and future clients. The groups, the judge said on Tuesday, would likely suffer “irreparable harm” without the funding. Emily Hilliard, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the care of migrant children, said in an email on Wednesday that the department did not comment on ongoing litigation. The order, which came into effect on Wednesday, will expire on April 16, with both parties able to file more briefs ahead of a final decision by the court.

"The move was an apparent bid to ensure that Israel is exempt from new tariffs that President Trump plans to announce on Wednesday.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The move was an apparent bid to ensure that Israel is exempt from new tariffs that President Trump plans to announce on Wednesday. By Matthew Mpoke Bigg Israel’s government has said it will cancel all remaining tariffs on American imports, in an apparent bid to ensure that it is exempt from a new wave of levies that President Trump is set to announce on Wednesday. Israel and the United States, two close allies, have had a free-trade agreement since 1985 that excludes most American products from Israeli tariffs. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel presented the decision to remove all remaining tariffs as a move toward greater trade liberalization. “Today we canceled all of the customs duties levied on products from the U.S., Israel’s largest trading partner,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “Canceling the customs duties on American goods is an additional step in the policy that my governments have led for a decade in opening up the market to competition.” The measure needs approval from the finance committee in the country’s Parliament, or Knesset, but is expected to pass, according to Israeli media. Total U.S. trade with Israel amounted to an estimated $37 billion in 2024, and the U.S. bilateral deficit stood at $7.4 billion, an 8.6 percent increase over the previous year, according to U.S. trade data. Israeli import taxes on U.S. goods amount to $11.3 million annually, with most levied on food, according to Israel’s finance ministry. Mr. Trump has already imposed several major tranches of tariffs, including ones that apply broadly to imports from China, Canada and Mexico. He has also announced tariffs on imported cars and car parts, which are set to go into effect on Thursday. The Trump administration has given few details about which countries and sectors will be included in the tariffs announcement on Wednesday, and it was not clear whether the levies would affect Israel. Israel was the latest country to adopt measures that appear designed to forestall the imposition of any American levies. In one example, Mexico has sent accused cartel leaders to the United States to face criminal charges and dispatched troops to fentanyl laboratories and the U.S. border. Mr. Trump has said that the latest tariffs will be imposed on adversaries like China as well as on countries that have traditionally been considered allies of the United States. The Trump administration argues that the tariffs will rebalance global trade in America’s favor, prevent other nations from taking advantage of the country’s largesse, promote domestic industry by making it cheaper for companies to base factories in the United States and raise revenue for the U.S. treasury. In response, the leaders of some of America’s largest trading partners have adopted various approaches. Canada, the European Union and China have imposed retaliatory tariffs in response to sweeping levies previously announced by the Trump administration.

But with a handful of Republicans in favor, the vote sent a signal of opposition to the levies.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by A measure to cancel some Canadian tariffs is all but certain to stall in the House. But with a handful of Republicans in favor, the vote sent a signal of opposition to the levies. By Robert Jimison Reporting from Capitol Hill The Senate on Wednesday approved a measure that would block some of the tariffs President Trump has imposed on Canada, with a handful of Republicans joining Democrats to pass a resolution that would halt levies set to take effect this week. The measure is all but certain to stall in the House, where G.O.P. leaders have moved preemptively to shut down any move to end Mr. Trump’s tariffs. But Senate passage of the measure on a vote of 51 to 48 — just hours after Mr. Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on more than 100 trading partners, including the European Union, China, Britain and India — sent a signal of bipartisan congressional opposition to the president’s trade war. The resolution targets the emergency powers Mr. Trump invoked in February to impose sweeping tariffs on Canada, a move that has rattled markets and drawn bipartisan criticism from lawmakers concerned about the economic impact on their states and districts. Mr. Trump imposed the tariffs in an executive order that cited the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, a Cold War-era law that has most often been used to impose sanctions on rogue states and human rights violators. His administration argued that unchecked drug trafficking from Canada constituted a dire threat to American national security and used it as justification to unilaterally impose 25 percent tariffs on America’s closest trading partner. “The president has justified the imposition of these tariffs on, in my view, a made-up emergency,” said Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia and the lead sponsor of the resolution. “The fentanyl emergency is from Mexico and China. It’s not from Canada.” The resolution, cosponsored by two fellow Democrats, Senators Mark Warner of Virginia and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, seeks to revoke the emergency declaration and, with it, Mr. Trump’s ability to enforce the tariffs set to go into effect on Wednesday.

She worked as a prosecutor and in private practice before joining the bench. By Claire Moses Judge Susan Crawford won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court on Tuesday, defeating Judge Brad Schimel, who was backed by President Trump, and overcoming $25 million in spending from Elon Musk in a race that became somewhat of a referendum on the billionaire and his slashing of the federal government. Her election could affect decisions on abortion and labor rights. While Judge Crawford, 60, may not have been a nationally recognizable name before Tuesday, this was not her first election. In 2018, she was elected as a circuit judge in Dane County, and she won re-election in 2022. transcript Susan! Susan! Susan! Susan! As a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be taking on the richest man in the world – for justice in Wisconsin, and we won. My promise to Wisconsin is clear. I will be a fair, impartial and commonsense justice on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. And Wisconsin stood up and said loudly that justice does not have a price. Our courts are not for sale. Before becoming a judge, she spent years working for the Wisconsin Department of Justice, including as assistant attorney general. In 2009, Gov. Jim Doyle appointed her as his chief legal counsel, a job that she held until 2010. In that job, she also led the Governor’s Pardon Advisory Board, which reviews pardon applications and makes recommendations to the governor. In 2011, she joined the private law firm Cullen Weston Pines & Bach. Among the cases she worked on were a constitutional challenge to the state’s voter ID law and a contractual dispute between a passenger train manufacturer and the State of Wisconsin, according to the firm, which is now named Pines Bach. In 2013, she became a partner at the firm. Judge Crawford has spoken out in favor of abortion rights and has been a public proponent of collective bargaining rights and voting rights. Her campaign website promotes her time as a private practice attorney, when she “protected voting and workers’ rights, and represented Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin to defend access to reproductive health care.” Judge Crawford lives in Madison, the state’s capital. She is married to Shawn Peters, an academic at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and they have two children.

"Xavier Becerra, the former secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, may face Kamala Harris in a potential Democratic showdown in their home state.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Xavier Becerra, the former secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, may face Kamala Harris in a potential Democratic showdown in their home state. By Laurel Rosenhall Reporting from Sacramento Xavier Becerra, a former Biden cabinet secretary who led California’s legal battles against President Trump’s first-term agenda, announced a run for California governor on Wednesday, setting up a potential clash with former Vice President Kamala Harris. She is considering running for governor, scrambling the 2026 contest to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom, who cannot run again because of term limits. Mr. Becerra’s announcement creates a potential scenario in which two Democrats, both of whom were in the same presidential cabinet and both of whom served as California attorney general, battle for the state’s top job. Mr. Becerra said he decided to run even if Ms. Harris does too. “What I can tell you with full confidence is, it doesn’t matter who gets in — I’m in,” he said in an interview. The ties between Mr. Becerra and Ms. Harris date back to the aftermath of the 2016 election, when they effectively traded jobs. She had been California’s attorney general and was elected to the U.S. Senate that year. He had been a congressman and was appointed attorney general after Ms. Harris resigned to join the Senate. They amicably helped each other transition into those jobs, Mr. Becerra said. By the time Mr. Becerra was confirmed for his cabinet position in 2021, Ms. Harris was vice president. She administered his oath of office. “My wife held the Bible, and she swore me in,” Mr. Becerra recalled of Ms. Harris. As members of the Biden cabinet, they worked together frequently on issues related to women’s health care and reproductive rights, and during the 2024 presidential election Mr. Becerra campaigned for Ms. Harris.

"Daniel Lurie, the city’s new mayor, is scaling back a program that gives away clean foil, pipes and plastic straws for fentanyl consumption. Nonprofits will have to direct people toward treatment.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Daniel Lurie, the city’s new mayor, is scaling back a program that gives away clean foil, pipes and plastic straws for fentanyl consumption. Nonprofits will have to direct people toward treatment. By Heather Knight Reporting from San Francisco Plastic straws are banned in San Francisco, at least if you want to drink a soda or lemonade. Those smoking fentanyl, however, have been able to get them for free, at taxpayers’ expense. There was also the time five years ago, when the city helped pay for a billboard that showed smiling, glittery partygoers. “Do it with friends,” the public service message said, urging drug users to consume with others so they could treat a potential overdose. For decades, San Francisco has been a liberal city where those using drugs found easy access to their substance of choice and a government generally willing to tolerate addiction. City leaders emphasized a harm reduction approach, believing that more lives would be saved by helping users to consume safely than by punishing them. But Daniel Lurie, the moderate Democrat who became the city’s new mayor in January, said this week that things had gone too far. He told The New York Times that he would announce on Wednesday a new policy that walks back the free distribution of clean foil, pipes and plastic straws on the streets of San Francisco. The supplies were typically used to smoke fentanyl or methamphetamines, and the city spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on them. Mr. Lurie’s rollback was the latest sign that San Francisco was moving away from the far-left ideology that had made it a target of late-night comedians and conservative politicians. In recent years, voters have signaled a political shift by ousting a progressive district attorney and electing more moderate city leaders, including the new mayor and Board of Supervisors. “We’ve lost our way,” Mr. Lurie said on Tuesday as he walked around the city’s Tenderloin neighborhood, where fentanyl use and open-air drug markets have proliferated. “We are no longer going to sit by and allow people to kill themselves on the streets.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Then he started watching PragerU videos — and they resonated with him. Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York Times Supported by By Kellen Browning Photographs by Mark Abramson Reporting from Los Angeles In the summer of 2020, Xaviaer DuRousseau was preparing to appear on a Netflix reality show called “The Circle,” where a group of strangers, isolated in separate apartments, compete for a cash prize and occasionally adopt fake digital personas to trick one another. Mr. DuRousseau, then 23, was a progressive who marched in Black Lives Matter protests, had pushed his university to require ethnic studies courses as a graduation requirement and voted for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2016. For the TV show, producers wanted Mr. DuRousseau, a Black man, to pose as a white woman and lecture others about racial injustice, before revealing his true identity. Mr. DuRousseau spent hours boning up on right-wing politics to get ready for debates with conservative contestants. But as he watched videos from PragerU, the conservative advocacy group, and Candace Owens, a right-wing influencer, he found himself nodding along. Maybe, he began to think, the media really was targeting President Trump for taking on the political establishment. Maybe free college and free health care were unrealistic goals, despite what Mr. Sanders said. Maybe police brutality against Black people was less common than he thought.

"The justices handed a win, for now, to the Food and Drug Administration in its rejection of applications from makers of flavored liquids used in e-cigarettes.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Religious Charter School Challenge Advertisement Supported by The justices handed a win, for now, to the Food and Drug Administration in its rejection of applications from makers of flavored liquids used in e-cigarettes. By Adam LiptakAbbie VanSickle and Christina Jewett Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court handed a victory to the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday, tossing out an appeals court decision that had found the agency acted unlawfully in rejecting applications from two manufacturers of flavored liquids used in e-cigarettes with names like Jimmy the Juice Man Peachy Strawberry, Signature Series Mom’s Pistachio and Suicide Bunny Mother’s Milk and Cookies. In a unanimous decision written by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., the justices left in place, for now, an F.D.A. order that prohibited retailers from marketing flavored tobacco products, sending the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for further review. Justice Alito wrote that the agency’s denials of the applications were for the most part “sufficiently consistent” with agency guidance on tobacco regulations. The justices rejected a ruling by the appeals court that the agency had acted arbitrarily and capriciously and had tried to change the rules in the middle of the approval process. In the opinion, Justice Alito highlighted the possible dangers of the flavored products appealing to middle and high school students, writing that “the kaleidoscope of flavor options adds to the allure of e-cigarettes and has thus contributed to the booming demand for such products among young Americans.” “Flavors lure kids, which is why Congress gave F.D.A. the authority to make science-based decisions on what is appropriate for our nation’s health,” said Erika Sward, the assistant vice president for nationwide advocacy at the American Lung Association, who applauded the court’s ruling. Tony Abboud, the executive director of the Vapor Technology Association, a trade group, said in a statement that he was “deeply disappointed” by the ruling.

"The 38-year-old Democratic state lawmaker says that her party needs a generational shift.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The 38-year-old Democratic state lawmaker says that her party needs a generational shift. By Katie Glueck State Senator Mallory McMorrow of Michigan, a Democrat from the Detroit suburbs, jumped into her state’s U.S. Senate race on Wednesday, becoming the first prominent candidate to enter the contest, which will help decide control of the chamber next fall. The seat opened after Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat, announced his retirement, and the race — in a state that has often favored Democratic senators but twice voted for President Trump — will be among the most closely watched in the country next year. “We need new leaders,” Ms. McMorrow, 38, said in her announcement video. “The same people in D.C. who got us into this mess are not going to be the ones to get us out of it.” Ms. McMorrow won Democrats’ acclaim several years ago for defending liberal values while identifying herself as a “straight, white, Christian, married suburban mom,” and her announcement video featured national pundits remarking on the speech. She flipped a Republican-held district in 2018 and is the first woman to become State Senate majority whip, her campaign has noted, in Michigan’s history. She is unlikely to have the Democratic lane to herself for long. Democrats who have signaled that they are eyeing the Senate race include Representative Haley Stevens, a moderate from suburban Detroit; Representative Kristen McDonald Rivet, a Democrat who won a challenging House district in Michigan last year; and Abdul El-Sayed, an outgoing health director in Wayne County and a progressive who ran unsuccessfully against now-Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, in the 2018 primary. Ms. Whitmer, who is term-limited, has said she is uninterested in running for Senate. Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, has also taken himself out of contention. Whoever emerges from the Democratic primary, the race is expected to be competitive in the general election. Republicans who could or are expected to run include former Representative Mike Rogers, who narrowly lost to Senator Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat, in November, and Representative Bill Huizenga. Tudor Dixon, who lost the governor’s race to Ms. Whitmer in 2022, and Kevin Rinke, who lost that Republican primary, could look at runs for Senate or governor.

"The driver, Douglas Horn, sued the maker of a product advertised as THC-free under a federal racketeering law, saying he had suffered a business injury.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Religious Charter School Challenge Advertisement Supported by The driver, Douglas Horn, sued the maker of a product advertised as THC-free under a federal racketeering law, saying he had suffered a business injury. By Adam Liptak and Abbie VanSickle Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that a truck driver fired for failing a drug test after using a product which was falsely advertised to be free of THC may sue the manufacturer under a federal racketeering law. In a 5-to-4 decision, written by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the court sided with Douglas Horn, the driver, in a decision that could make it easier for people to sue companies under a federal racketeering statute that was originally aimed at fighting organized crime. Justice Barrett wrote that the product’s manufacturer, a company called Medical Marijuana Inc., was fighting a battle with that plain language of the racketeering law. “That is a battle it cannot win,” she wrote. The case turned on a narrow question: whether Mr. Horn could satisfy a requirement imposed by the law, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, to show that he had been injured in his “business or property.” Justice Barrett was joined in the majority with the court’s three liberal justices, along with Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissent, as did Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh who was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. The case, Medical Marijuana Inc. v. Horn, No. 23-365, started after Mr. Horn, who suffered from accident-related chronic pain, came across an article in High Times, a magazine that covers the business and culture of marijuana, concerning a product called Dixie X. The article said it was rich in CBD, a component of hemp that does not produce the high associated with marijuana, but contained “0 percent THC,” the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. After using Dixie X, which the manufacturer has called a wellness product, Mr. Horn failed a drug test and was fired. Suspecting that the product was to blame, he bought another bottle and had it tested. The testing company found that it contained THC and refused to mail it back to Mr. Horn, fearing penalties under federal drug laws. Mr. Horn sued under RICO, a law that was initially aimed at organized crime and allows an award of triple damages to plaintiffs who can show, among many other things, that the defendants’ racketeering activity injured them in their “business or property.” That phrase, the Supreme Court has previously said, excludes suits for personal injuries. Mr. Horn said three defendants — Medical Marijuana Inc., Dixie Holdings and Red Dice Holdings — had engaged in a pattern of racketeering carried on through an enterprise that included mail and wire fraud. A federal trial judge dismissed the suit, saying that Mr. Horn’s injury was personal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit disagreed, saying that “the phrase ‘business or property’ focuses on the nature of the harm, not the source of the harm.” Adam Liptak covers the Supreme Court and writes Sidebar, a column on legal developments.

"President Trump says that countries have been ripping off the United States for decades. There is some truth to that argument — but also a lot of hypocrisy.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by President Trump says that countries have been ripping off the United States for decades. There is some truth to that argument — but also a lot of hypocrisy. By Ana Swanson Ana Swanson covers international trade and is based in Washington. President Trump has accused America’s trading partners of undermining the United States for decades, saying they have engaged in unfair trade practices to steal the country’s wealth and enrich their own economies. He has set his sights not only on adversaries like China, but also traditional allies like Canada and Europe. And he has complained about a number of factors, including high tariffs that other countries charge American products, and persistent trade deficits the United States has with foreign countries. Mr. Trump has promised to correct this situation on Wednesday, when he announces expansive tariffs on foreign products that he says will level the playing field. In some cases, there’s truth to the president’s claim that the United States offers its trading partners more favorable terms than it often gets in return. As a proponent of free markets, the United States has long been more open to trade than many countries globally. That has encouraged the United States to rely on imports of many critical goods, like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, instead of manufacturing them itself. And some countries do have tough trade barriers to U.S. exports, or economic policies that distort global markets — particularly China, which has flooded the world with manufactured goods. Still, trade experts say that Mr. Trump’s claims include a heavy dose of exaggeration, as well as hypocrisy. For example, Mr. Trump has singled out high tariff rates that countries charge on certain U.S. exports including Europe’s tax on cars and India’s levy on motorcycles. But the United States also has high tariff rates that it charges on certain imports, such as a 25 percent fee on light trucks. And Mr. Trump has lumped in friendly allies like Canada, which have some limits to U.S. exports outside a few sectors, with nations like China, which have extensive trade barriers.

"The court will decide whether Medicaid beneficiaries may sue to receive services under a law that lets them choose any qualified provider.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Religious Charter School Challenge Advertisement Supported by The court will decide whether Medicaid beneficiaries may sue to receive services under a law that lets them choose any qualified provider. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court heard arguments on Wednesday in a case arising from South Carolina’s attempt to deny funding to Planned Parenthood. But the question the justices grappled with was a relatively narrow one, focused on whether individuals may sue the state to obtain medical services from Planned Parenthood unrelated to abortion. In 2018, Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina, a Republican, ordered state officials to deny Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood, saying that “payment of taxpayer funds to abortion clinics, for any purpose, results in the subsidy of abortion and the denial of the right to life.” Medicaid gives federal money to states to provide medical care for poor people, but it sets some conditions. One is that eligible participants may receive assistance from any provider qualified to perform the required services. Abortions are banned in South Carolina after six weeks of pregnancy, and, even then, federal law prohibits the use of Medicaid funding except in life-threatening circumstances or in cases of rape or incest. But Planned Parenthood clinics in Charleston and Columbia provide services unrelated to abortion, including counseling, physical exams, contraception and screenings for cancer and sexually transmitted infections. Planned Parenthood and a patient who sought contraception sued under a federal civil rights law, and a federal trial judge blocked the South Carolina directive, saying that it ran afoul of Medicaid’s requirement that patients may choose any qualified provider. The litigation that followed was convoluted and circuitous, focusing largely on whether that provision created a right that individuals could enforce by filing lawsuits. The Supreme Court has said that federal laws like Medicaid, which give money to states but only if they accept certain conditions, must “unambiguously confer individual federal rights” to give affected individuals the right to sue.

"If confirmed, Stanley Woodward would join a number of other former lawyers for President Trump who have been selected to key law enforcement positions.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by If confirmed, Stanley Woodward would join a number of other former lawyers for President Trump who have been selected to key law enforcement positions. By Devlin Barrett Reporting from Washington The Trump administration said on Wednesday that the president had chosen Stanley Woodward Jr., who has defended several key figures in his orbit, for the No. 3 position at the Justice Department. Since January, Mr. Woodward has served as a lawyer at the White House, a reflection of the trust he developed in President Trump’s inner circle during a tumultuous period in 2022 and 2023 when Mr. Trump faced multiple criminal investigations and prosecutions. He rose to prominence representing Mr. Trump’s personal aide in the investigation into his handling of classified documents after he left office. If the Senate confirms him as associate attorney general, Mr. Woodward will oversee a number of important parts of the department, including civil litigation, civil rights, antitrust, tax and environmental work. Historically, the associate attorney general also plays a major role in formulating department policy and coordinating with the White House. He would also become the department’s chief officer overseeing lawsuits involving the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. Woodward would join a department already dominated by senior officials who previously served as lawyers for Mr. Trump, including Attorney General Pam Bondi; the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche; and the principal associate deputy attorney general, Emil Bove III. D. John Sauer, who represented Mr. Trump before the Supreme Court, is poised to become the solicitor general if confirmed on Thursday by the Senate. Mr. Woodward has also represented senior aides to the president who came under investigation, as well as people charged in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on Congress. But it was in the classified documents investigation that Mr. Woodward proved his value to the president. In representing Mr. Trump’s aide, Walt Nauta, Mr. Woodward often played a significant role in devising and executing defense strategy. Mr. Nauta first began working as a valet for Mr. Trump at the White House and stayed with him as a private employee when the president left office.

"Democratic senators said in a letter that the administration was failing its first test of humanitarian aid as China and Russia send teams to help.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","U.S.A.I.D. Advertisement Supported by Democratic senators said in a letter that the administration was failing its first test of humanitarian aid as China and Russia send teams to help. By Edward Wong Reporting from Washington Democratic senators sent a letter to the Trump administration on Wednesday criticizing what they called the paltry U.S. aid response to the earthquake in Myanmar, where China and Russia have sent rescue and relief teams. The six senators said in the letter that the United States appeared to be failing the first test of its ability to respond to a humanitarian crisis in the wake of the Trump administration’s drastic cuts to foreign aid and dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development, the main aid agency. “We are deeply concerned that the administration’s response is failing to meet both our moral and strategic objectives — sending a signal to countries around the world that our adversaries are more reliable and trustworthy than the United States,” the senators wrote. The New York Times obtained a copy of the letter, which was organized by the offices of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the ranking member on the Banking Committee, and Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee. The other senators who signed were Tim Kaine of Virginia, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. The senators sent it to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Mr. Rubio and a political appointee at the State Department, Pete Marocco, oversaw the slashing of foreign aid, and Mr. Bessent’s agency oversees financial sanctions on Myanmar. The senators said in the letter that the U.S. government should grant sanctions waivers to any earthquake relief going into Myanmar. The United States did not send any specialist aid teams to Myanmar after the earthquake hit on Friday. More than 2,700 people have died as buildings there and in neighboring Thailand collapsed, according to the ruling authoritarian military leaders of Myanmar. The junta asked other nations for help. China, Russia and India sent teams and supplies, as did Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"American Jews have watched with both alarm and enthusiasm as strong-arm tactics, including arrests of activists, have been deployed in their name.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown  American Jews have watched with both alarm and enthusiasm as strong-arm tactics, including arrests of activists, have been deployed in their name.  American Jews have watched with both alarm and enthusiasm as strong-arm tactics, including arrests of activists, have been deployed in their name. “This is not going to protect Jews,” Rabbi Sharon Brous said. “We’re being used.”Credit...Morgan Lieberman for The New York Times Supported by By J. David Goodman Rabbi Sharon Brous was growing increasingly alarmed at the Trump administration’s strong-arm tactics, like its attacks on higher-education funding and bullying of law firms, all in the name of protecting Jews. So early last month, she delivered an impassioned sermon titled “I Am Not Your Pawn” to her Los Angeles congregation. Hours later, the next shoe dropped. Immigration agents began detaining activists and foreign students who had been involved in pro-Palestinian protests. “This is not going to protect Jews,” Rabbi Brous said in an interview. “We’re being used.” Across the country, American Jews have watched with alarm or enthusiasm as an effort to address campus unrest over the war in Gaza has transformed into a campaign to deny elite universities billions of dollars in funding, to press major law firms into pro bono work on “antisemitism” and to deport foreign students even tangentially involved in the protests last spring. “We have to combat antisemitism as vigorously as we can,” said Matt Brooks, the chief executive of the Republican Jewish Coalition, adding that with President Trump in office, there is “a new sheriff in town.” The divisions mirror those that have long split Jewish communities and have grown deeper since the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, and the broad campus protests that followed Israel’s devastating response in Gaza.

By Annie Karni Reporting from the Capitol Speaker Mike Johnson’s failed effort this week to shut down a bipartisan bid to allow new parents in Congress to vote remotely after the birth of a child highlighted the limits of his power and intensified a fight that has ground the House to a halt. The clash underscored — yet again — how dependent the speaker has become on President Trump to keep Republicans in line. And it raised questions about whether Mr. Johnson, in his haste to transform the House into an organ of compliance to Mr. Trump, may have lost sight of the importance of gauging what rank-and-file lawmakers will and will not tolerate. Instead, he ran roughshod over the will of a majority of House members — something speakers throughout history have done at their peril — and chose a battle it’s not clear he can win. “Disappointing result on the floor there,” a hangdog Mr. Johnson told reporters in an interview on Tuesday, after nine Republicans defied him and voted with a united bloc of Democrats to keep the proxy voting measure alive. “Very unfortunate in this case.” Mr. Johnson noted that “96 percent of House Republicans voted against it.” But that was a statistic that didn’t really matter when what he needed was near-unanimity within the G.O.P. It was a tacit admission that his strong-arm tactics to try to block a vote on a measure that a majority of House members backed had been a miscalculation. The embarrassment on the floor was a cold reminder that without Mr. Trump acting as his outside enforcer, Mr. Johnson wields far less power over his fractious conference.

"The case has raised questions not only about how the man could have ended up on a plane to El Salvador, but also about why the administration has apparently not moved to correct its mistake.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The case has raised questions not only about how the man could have ended up on a plane to El Salvador, but also about why the administration has apparently not moved to correct its mistake. By Alan Feuer Lawyers for a Maryland man who was inadvertently deported last month to a notorious Salvadoran prison despite an order that he could remain in the United States angrily urged the judge overseeing his case on Wednesday to force the Trump administration to bring him back as soon as possible. In a court filing, the lawyers for the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, furiously took issue with almost every aspect of the case. To start, they said, Trump officials had acknowledged on Monday night that they had made an “administrative error” by flying Mr. Abrego Garcia to El Salvador on March 15 even though a U.S. immigration judge had already determined that he might face torture there. The lawyers also expressed shock that the administration was maintaining that it had little power to get Mr. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national whose wife and child are both American citizens, out of custody. The prison where he is being held, known as CECOT, has long had a reputation of having brutal conditions. “Defendants have already washed their hands of plaintiff, of his U.S.-citizen wife, of his autistic nonverbal five-year-old U.S.-citizen child,” the lawyers wrote. “Defendants’ proposed resolution of this state of affairs, which they caused either intentionally or at best recklessly, is nothing at all. This is an outrageous set of facts.” The case of Mr. Abrego Garcia, 29, is the latest flashpoint in a multifront and increasingly bitter battle between immigration lawyers and the White House, which in recent weeks has been escalating its efforts to deport hundreds of migrants using both traditional and highly unorthodox methods. The case has raised questions not only about how a man whom a judge had granted permission to remain in the United States could have ended up on a plane to El Salvador, but also about why the Trump administration has apparently done nothing to correct its mistake.

Shift in margin More Dem. More Rep. The map above shows how votes cast in the Supreme Court election compared with votes from the 2024 presidential election in the same county. Only counties that have reported almost all of their votes are shown. Source: The Associated Press By Jasmine C. Lee By Reid J. Epstein Reid J. Epstein has reported on Wisconsin politics on and off since 2002. He reported from Madison, Wis. Again and again, Republicans repeated their goal for the Wisconsin Supreme Court election on Tuesday: Get more than 60 percent of President Trump’s voters to back Judge Brad Schimel, the conservative candidate, and they would win, flipping the court’s majority back to the right. Judge Schimel hit his mark: He won 62 percent of Mr. Trump’s November total in the state. He drew more votes even than Justice Janet Protasiewicz had received in Wisconsin’s 2023 contest for the court, when she delivered an 11-point thumping to the conservative candidate. That was the last judicial race that Democrats had turned into a national cause. The problem for Republicans this time was that Susan Crawford, the liberal candidate on Tuesday, won 78 percent of Vice President Kamala Harris’s vote total in Wisconsin — an astonishing figure for a spring election in an off year, and one that made a mockery of the bar the G.O.P. had set for itself. This was an across-the-map thrashing: Judge Crawford’s percentage of the Harris vote was higher than Judge Schimel’s percentage of the Trump vote in every one of Wisconsin’s 72 counties. All told, Tuesday’s result was the inverse of what the state’s Democrats had faced in November, when the party turned out what it thought would be enough voters for Ms. Harris to win the state, only to get swamped by a far larger showing for Mr. Trump. The turnout advantage for Judge Crawford was strongest in Wisconsin’s college towns and rural areas, where the Democratic Party’s organizational advantage is most pronounced. Turnout in off-year elections is typically well below a presidential election, but Judge Susan Crawford managed to win more than 80 percent of the support that Vice President Kamala Harris got in many counties. Data is as of April 2 at 11 a.m. Eastern time. Source: The Associated Press By Eric Rabinowitz We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"A summary of the police investigation, released two years after the attack, found that the shooter had spent years planning the violence and covering up mental health problems.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by A summary of the police investigation, released two years after the attack, found that the shooter had spent years planning the violence and covering up mental health problems. By Emily Cochrane Emily Cochrane lives in Nashville and has covered the aftermath of the Covenant School shooting since March 2023. The shooter who killed three third graders and three staff members at the Covenant School in Nashville two years ago acted alone in hopes of achieving infamy, a police investigation has concluded. The investigation, a summary of which the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department released on Wednesday, found that the shooter, a former student at the private Christian school, had spent years carefully planning an attack. It also found that the shooter had hidden growing mental health struggles from relatives and therapists to ensure the attack succeeded. The investigation absolved family members, therapists and those who sold guns to the 28-year-old shooter, whose legal name was Audrey Hale, of any culpability. The report noted that legally, there was little the shooter’s parents could do, given that the weapons were purchased and owned legally in a state with few restrictions. In the aftermath of the school shooting, the worst in Tennessee’s history, there were months of protests calling for tighter gun laws. Gun rights groups, journalists and a Republican state lawmaker sued for the release of writings left by the shooter, something the families of the victims and most surviving students sought to stop. Last July, a judge in Nashville refused to allow the publication of journals, art or video created by the shooter, though the judge ruled that any investigative findings could be released. Her ruling was appealed. The absence of a clear motive or significant social media postings by the Nashville shooter inflamed rampant speculation that has not fully subsided. After police officials said that the shooter identified as transgender, right-wing activists intensified attacks on transgender people, claimed a connection between the shooting and the assailant’s gender identity without citing any evidence, and speculated about a conspiracy to cover up details about a killing at a Christian school.

By Adeel Hassan The preschooler, Belle Thomas, and her 1-year-old brother, Preston, are standing still, looking straight into the camera lens and smiling. It’s picture-perfect, and the photographer is ready. Click. Just then, a 6-foot-1, two-term former president of the United States strides into the frame. In a few seconds, the photo shoot is over, and the photos are no longer of the siblings alone. That’s how Barack Obama inadvertently became part of a family’s moment early Monday morning at the Tidal Basin in Washington. The family was elated to have him as an interloper, the parents said. “What! Barack Obama is in my picture?” exclaimed Belle, 4, the preschooler, during the joyous aftermath, when her parents, grandparents, and the family photographer, Briana Inell, realized that Mr. Obama had indeed been part of four or five frames. The photographer had not planned it that way. “I was trying to frame my picture, make sure that the Washington Monument is on the left and the blossoms are on the right, and the babies are in the center,” Ms. Inell said on Wednesday. In the moment, Ms. Inell — who has been taking photos during peak cherry blossom season for the last 10 years — did not even notice as Mr. Obama entered the frame.

"The administration concluded last month that Maine had violated federal law by allowing transgender athletes to play on girls’ or women’s teams.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The administration concluded last month that Maine had violated federal law by allowing transgender athletes to play on girls’ or women’s teams. By Jenna Russell The Department of Agriculture said on Thursday that it had frozen federal funding for education programs in Maine, the latest in a barrage of actions targeting the state since its Democratic governor, Janet Mills, sparred with President Trump over the issue of transgender athletes at the White House in February. The agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, notified Ms. Mills in a letter that funding would be stopped while the agency reviews grants awarded to Maine by the Biden administration, many of which “appear to be wasteful, redundant, or otherwise against the priorities of the Trump administration,” Ms. Rollins wrote in the letter, according to a statement. It was not immediately clear which educational programs would be affected by the funding freeze. The government’s statement said its latest action would not alter “federal feeding programs or direct assistance to citizens.” Since Feb. 21, when Mr. Trump told Ms. Mills that she had “better comply” with his executive order barring transgender women from participating in women’s sports, federal agencies have initiated several investigations of Maine’s public education system. The administration concluded last month that Maine had violated federal law by allowing transgender athletes to play on girls’ or women’s teams. Maine has declined to accept a proposed settlement agreement that would require it to change a state law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity. Ms. Mills maintains that only the state legislature can change the law. Investigations of the state continued to multiply last week, as the Department of Education began a new inquiry based on the allegation that Maine schools illegally withheld information from the parents of transgender students. The escalating conflict has spurred protests for and against Ms. Mills in the politically divided state, where temporary cuts to grant-funded programs at the University of Maine threatened to curtail coastal research used to manage the state’s fisheries and protect its waterfront from rising seas.

"After a failed $20 million effort to tilt a State Supreme Court race, Elon Musk joins the ranks of billionaires frustrated by the laws of politics.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Elections Advertisement Newsletter After a failed $20 million effort to tilt a State Supreme Court race, Elon Musk joins the ranks of billionaires frustrated by the laws of politics. By Lisa Lerer Elon Musk learned an important lesson on Tuesday: Money isn’t everything. His $20 million effort to tilt a State Supreme Court race in Wisconsin to Republicans’ preferred candidate — and, as Musk said just hours before voting ended, to determine the fate of “Western civilization” — ended in failure when Democratic voters swamped the polls. Musk isn’t the first wealthy man to discover that pouring cash into a campaign doesn’t guarantee victory. Just ask Michael Bloomberg. Or Tom Steyer. But although Musk made the wrong financial bet, he was right that the race carried far larger stakes than simply the balance of Wisconsin’s highest court. The contest will help both parties craft a political strategy for next year’s midterm elections. Special elections, like the one in Wisconsin, offer early clues about the political environment. For weeks, strategists have been wondering about the political impact of Musk, who has emerged as one of the most indefatigable forces in the new administration. While polling indicates that Musk is broadly unpopular with Democrats and independents, some strategists wondered if he could drive Republicans to the polls, particularly in races where President Trump is not on the ballot. Wisconsin offers an early indication that Musk does energize voters. Just not, perhaps, the ones he was aiming for. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"In February, security camera footage showed a masked figure spraying the reindeer with an unknown liquid. The police have no leads.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by In February, security camera footage showed a masked figure spraying the reindeer with an unknown liquid. The police have no leads. By Hank Sanders Star VII, the famous reindeer who led parades and cultural events as the unofficial mascot of Anchorage, Alaska, was euthanized on Tuesday, just weeks after a masked figure sprayed the animal with a mysterious liquid before vanishing into the night. Under the cloak of darkness on Feb. 20, someone jumped into Star’s enclosure and let the 8-year-old male reindeer out onto the streets of Anchorage, security footage showed. The next night, after the police found the animal and returned him to his owner, Albert Whitehead, another masked figure approached the reindeer and sprayed him with an unknown substance. The Anchorage Police Department said on Wednesday that it did not have any leads into the person or persons responsible. The department said that it assumed that the person who let Star out of the enclosure was the same person who later sprayed him with the liquid. A detective is working on the case and is seeking the public’s help, the department said. In the days after Star VII was attacked, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and became so sick that Mr. Whitehead, 84, considered putting him down to take him out of his misery. But a treatment program from a veterinary clinic helped Star’s condition improve, and Mr. Whitehead had believed Star could make a full recovery. Then, about two weeks later, Star’s condition deteriorated again. “His ruminate started going back out through his nostrils,” Mr. Whitehead said in a phone interview on Wednesday. “Something is going on in the stomach. You don’t know what that is.” Unlike cows, “almost 100 percent” of reindeer do not survive stomach surgery, Mr. Whitehead said. He said he would not know the cause of death until a necropsy has concluded. He said he thought that the liquid that was sprayed at his animal was air freshener, but has not confirmed that. “We feel extremely sad,” Mr. Whitehead said. “They hurt an unknown animal for some unknown reason. I just don’t understand why people would do that.” Star VII was, as his name suggests, the seventh such unofficial Anchorage mascot. Normally, as with the pope or the Dalai Lama, when one Star dies, another Star is named. But Mr. Whitehead, who was also the main caretaker for Star VI, said he was not comfortable naming a Star VIII. “I don’t feel safe putting another animal in that pen,” Mr. Whitehead said. If the culprit is caught, Mr. Whitehead said, he “would revisit” the possibility of caring for a Star VIII.

"Republicans began investigating ActBlue, the Democratic Party’s main fund-raising platform, last year in part of a broader bid to target key Democratic organizations.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Republicans began investigating ActBlue, the Democratic Party’s main fund-raising platform, last year in part of a broader bid to target key Democratic organizations. By Reid J. Epstein and Shane Goldmacher The leaders of three Republican-led House committees accused ActBlue, the main Democratic fund-raising platform, of complacency in fraud prevention and demanded more information about the recent resignations of a raft of top executives. “ActBlue’s internal turmoil, lack of a functioning legal team, possible retaliatory actions and failure to take fraud seriously raise a host of new questions about the platform’s ability to deter fraud and comply with legal requirements,” the chairmen of the House Judiciary, Oversight and Administration committees wrote in a four-page letter on Wednesday. The Republican chairmen specifically demanded documents related to the resignation of officials in the general counsel’s office of ActBlue, which were first reported last month by The New York Times. Republicans began investigating ActBlue last year, and the efforts are part of a broader bid to target key pieces of the Democratic political infrastructure. The committee chairmen, Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio, James Comer of Kentucky and Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, also demanded testimony from two ActBlue employees whose names were redacted from a copy of the letter posted online. The letter accompanied an interim staff report that was released on Wednesday, along with nearly 500 pages of internal ActBlue documents, accusing the nonprofit of “a fundamentally unserious approach to fraud prevention.” Megan Hughes, a spokeswoman for ActBlue, said in a statement: “As we have historically done, ActBlue will continue to respond to requests from the House committees.” The interim report from Republicans on the Judiciary, Oversight and Administration committees accused ActBlue of having “lowered its fraud-prevention standards” in 2024, pointing to, among other examples, a fraud specialist citing an annual goal that included “D.E.I. work.” While the report accused the company of opening the door to fraud, it did not contain any notable new examples but rather said the documents that it had “paint a picture of complacency.” The turmoil at ActBlue was set off in late February when two unions that represent its staff members wrote a letter to ActBlue’s board warning that the departures of the lawyers in the firm’s general counsel’s office had left the remaining employees facing legal risk for their actions. It remains unclear what instigated so many sudden departures from ActBlue. None of the officials who left the company have agreed to be interviewed on the record. But the tumult and the congressional investigation come at a perilous moment for ActBlue and the Democratic candidates and causes that rely on it to process their fund-raising. Republicans at the Capitol and in the Trump administration are vying to cripple mechanisms Democrats rely on for finances and communications. When a phone-banking system Democrats use went down briefly last weekend during the final get-out-the-vote period before Wisconsin’s Supreme Court election, some Democrats fretted that it could have been sabotaged by the political right, and then worried anew about the potential of Elon Musk’s buying Democratic tech firms in order to shut them down.

"G.O.P. leaders are planning to use the “nuclear option” to steer around the Senate’s in-house referee and allow the use of a gimmick that makes trillions of dollars in tax cuts appear to be free.",2025-04-02,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by G.O.P. leaders are planning to use the “nuclear option” to steer around the Senate’s in-house referee and allow the use of a gimmick that makes trillions of dollars in tax cuts appear to be free. By Catie Edmondson Reporting from the Capitol For decades, senators looking to push major budget and tax legislation through Congress on a simple majority vote have had to win the blessing of a single unelected figure on Capitol Hill. The Senate parliamentarian, a civil servant who acts as the arbiter and enforcer of the chamber’s byzantine rules, has traditionally been in a position to make or break entire presidential agendas. That includes determining whether budget and tax legislation can be fast-tracked through Congress and shielded from a filibuster, allowing it to pass along party lines through a process known as reconciliation. Now, in their zeal to deliver President Trump’s domestic policy agenda in “one big beautiful bill” of spending and tax cuts, Senate Republicans are trying to steer around the parliamentarian, busting a substantial congressional norm in the process. The strategy would allow them to avoid getting a formal thumbs up or thumbs down on their claim that extending the tax cuts that Mr. Trump signed into law in 2017 would cost nothing — a gimmick that would make it easier for them to cram as many tax reductions as possible into their bill without appearing to balloon the deficit. In recent days, all eyes have been on Elizabeth MacDonough, the parliamentarian, to see whether she would bless the trick, smoothing the path for the G.O.P. bill. But on Wednesday, Republicans signaled that they planned to take extraordinary action to go around her altogether. Rather than have Ms. MacDonough weigh in, they asserted that Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, as chairman of the Budget Committee, could unilaterally decide the cost of the legislation, citing a 1974 budget law. Senate Republicans on Wednesday unveiled a new budget resolution they planned to put to a vote as early as this week. And Mr. Graham declared in a statement that he considered an extension of the 2017 tax cuts to be cost-free. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Mark Green, a Republican who once worked under President Trump, stepped down as head of the Wilson Center after employees of Elon Musk’s team visited the think tank.",2025-04-03,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Mark Green, a Republican who once worked under President Trump, stepped down as head of the Wilson Center after employees of Elon Musk’s team visited the think tank. By Aishvarya Kavi and Edward Wong Reporting from Washington The head of the Wilson Center, a storied foreign policy think tank, resigned on Tuesday, a day after employees from Elon Musk’s government-overhauling team arrived at the group’s Washington headquarters to dismantle it, according to people familiar with the actions at the center. The resignation of the president, Mark Green, a Republican, and the visit from Mr. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team, indicated that the Trump administration was carrying out an executive order President Trump signed last month directing that the organization, a nonpartisan policy group, be largely dismantled. After DOGE team members visited the center on Monday and Tuesday, some of the leadership staff and senior government employees were ousted, including Mr. Green, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution by political appointees in the Trump administration. The center’s dozens of federal employees, about a third of its work force, were also set to be placed on administrative leave. The apparent gutting of the Wilson Center would be the latest attempt by the Trump administration to bring federally funded institutions that have historically been independent under executive branch control, and in much diminished forms. Mr. Musk and his task force have helped lead efforts at slashing those institutions and various federal agencies. One person familiar with Mr. Green’s resignation said he had been offered a choice: Step down or be fired. Mr. Green, who has been a Wisconsin congressman, an ambassador to Tanzania and head of the now-defunct U.S. Agency for International Development during Mr. Trump’s first term, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. After the March executive order calling for the center to be reduced “to the minimum presence and function required by law,” Mr. Green wrote in an email to members that its leaders had viewed the order and were “crafting plans to comply.” He did not say whether the center would push back against the executive order.

By Michael Crowley Michael Crowley traveled to Brussels aboard Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s government plane and is covering his NATO meetings there. Secretary of State Marco Rubio traveled to Brussels on Thursday for a gathering of NATO foreign ministers amid high anxiety over the Trump administration’s approach to Europe, including the war in Ukraine, relations with Russia and President Trump’s growing trade war with the continent. Mr. Rubio’s visit to the alliance’s headquarters comes as relations between the United States and Europe have abruptly shifted from the close cooperation of the Biden era to mistrust and acrimony under Mr. Trump. At the same time, NATO officials may welcome a chance to confer with Mr. Rubio, whom many consider the most pro-alliance member of Mr. Trump’s national security team. As a senator in 2023, representing Florida, Mr. Rubio cosponsored legislation requiring any president to seek the Senate’s advice and consent before withdrawing from the organization. Former aides say Mr. Trump has privately mused about taking that step, which would shatter the 32-nation military alliance formed to counter Russia. Foreign officials who have dealt with Mr. Rubio since he became Mr. Trump’s top diplomat have described him as downplaying some of Mr. Trump’s wilder ideas and translating them into more realistic policy approaches, although they also question whether he truly speaks for a president with whom he does not have a close personal relationship. In that vein, Mr. Rubio arrived in Brussels on Thursday with some reassurances about Mr. Trump’s views on the alliance. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The lawyer of the white supremacist who slaughtered 23 people in 2019 said his client was inspired by President Trump’s words, the same the president is using today.",2025-04-03,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The lawyer of the white supremacist who slaughtered 23 people in 2019 said his client was inspired by President Trump’s words, the same the president is using today. By Edgar Sandoval and Reyes Mata III Reporting from El Paso Five and a half years ago, Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old with a documented history of mental illness, stopped at a Walmart in the border city of El Paso, heard everyone around him speaking in Spanish, and decided “the invasion” that then-President Donald J. Trump often spoke of was underway. Mr. Crusius’s rampage on Aug. 3, 2019, took the lives of 23 people, both U.S. citizens and Mexican nationals who had crossed the border to do some shopping, becoming the deadliest attack on Hispanic civilians in American history. His attorney, Joe Spencer, said on Tuesday in an interview ahead of his client’s sentencing hearing scheduled for April 21 for state charges that Mr. Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric was to blame. The president’s words, combined with “severe mental illness,” fueled Mr. Crusius’s hate, the lawyer said in his office in El Paso. “He thinks this is the invasion,” said Mr. Spencer, who has represented the gunman since his arrest. He added, “In his mind, he’s saying, ‘I’m getting a direct order from the president. I have to do something.’” Mr. Spencer made similar comments last week to El Paso Matters, a local publication. The ugly saga, which began in a fusillade of bullets and was then mired by legal setbacks and red tape, concludes this month just as the same anti-immigration rhetoric that may have inspired the Walmart gunman returns with Mr. Trump’s second administration. The president is embarking on an aggressive campaign to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and the word “invasion” is now a legal pretext for deportations and foreign incarceration with little to no due process, critics say. That has cast a pall over El Paso just when the families of the victims and survivors of the deadly shooting of 2019 must confront the crime again. Christopher Morales, 39, whose aunt was killed that day and whose mother and grandmother suffered severe injures, said Mr. Trump’s influence will be on his mind when he attends the sentencing hearing.

"A new report by neonatal and toxicology experts casts doubt on the test results that were pivotal to the case against the British nurse.",2025-04-03,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by A new report by neonatal and toxicology experts casts doubt on the test results that were pivotal to the case against the British nurse. By Michael D. Shear Reporting from London Seven pediatric doctors and toxicology experts said on Thursday that jurors were misled by prosecutors who cited unreliable insulin tests during the trial of Lucy Letby, a nurse convicted of murdering seven babies at a British hospital. The doctors made their assertions in a new report that Ms. Letby’s lawyer submitted to Britain’s Criminal Cases Review Commission, which is responsible for investigating possible miscarriages of justice, in the hopes of being allowed to pursue a full appeal of her 15 life sentences. Ms. Letby, who worked as a nurse in a neonatal unit at a hospital in northern England, was found guilty in 2023 of deliberately harming — and in seven cases, murdering — babies by injecting them with air, overfeeding them with milk, infusing air into their gastrointestinal tracts or poisoning them with insulin. In the new report, the experts, who include a forensic toxicologist, a professor of forensic science and an endocrinologist who has written multiple peer-reviewed papers on medical test errors, attacked the validity of the evidence of insulin poisoning used by the prosecution at trial. “Our inescapable conclusion is that this evidence significantly undermines the validity of the assertions made about the insulin and C-peptide testing presented in Court,” they wrote in a summary of the report provided to reporters by her legal team. Ms. Letby has always maintained her innocence. Since her two trials, serious questions have been raised about her guilt, including in a 13,000-word New Yorker article last May. But efforts by her lawyers to reopen the case with a full appeal have been repeatedly denied. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"During the 30-minute meeting, the far-right activist excoriated National Security Council officials in front of the president and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser.",2025-04-03,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by During the 30-minute meeting, the far-right activist excoriated National Security Council officials in front of the president and Michael Waltz, the national security adviser. By Maggie HabermanJonathan Swan and Ken Bensinger Reporting from Washington President Trump fired six National Security Council officials after an extraordinary meeting in the Oval Office with the far-right activist Laura Loomer, who laid out a list of people she believed were disloyal to the president, U.S. officials said on Thursday. The firings were described by one of the U.S. officials, who had direct knowledge of the matter. The decision came after Ms. Loomer vilified the staff members by name during a meeting on Wednesday, when she walked into the White House with a sheaf of papers attacking the character and loyalty of numerous N.S.C. officials. Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, joined later in the meeting and briefly defended some of his staff, though it was clear he had little if any power to protect their jobs. It was a remarkable spectacle: Ms. Loomer, who has floated the baseless conspiracy theory that the Sept. 11 attacks were an “inside job” and is viewed as extreme by even some of Mr. Trump’s far-right allies, was apparently wielding more influence over the staff of the National Security Council than Mr. Waltz, who runs the agency. A longtime supporter of Mr. Trump who has frequently spoken of her desire to work with him, Ms. Loomer was one of Mr. Trump’s most vicious online enforcers during the 2024 campaign. The account of the White House meeting with Ms. Loomer and the subsequent firings is based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the events. They asked for anonymity to discuss confidential meetings and conversations. The people fired included Brian Walsh, the senior director for intelligence; Maggie Dougherty, the senior director for international organizations; and Thomas Boodry, the senior director for legislative affairs. None could be reached for comment. To some in the government, the firings felt arbitrary. Most if not all of the officials who have been targeted by Ms. Loomer were put through a personnel vetting process run by the Trump administration.

"State education officials will be required to verify that they have eliminated all programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion that the administration deems unlawful, according to a new memo.",2025-04-03,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by State education officials will be required to verify that they have eliminated all programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion that the administration deems unlawful, according to a new memo. By Michael C. Bender Reporting from Washington The Trump administration threatened on Thursday to withhold federal funding from public schools unless state education officials verified the elimination of all programs that it said unfairly promoted diversity, equity and inclusion. In a memo sent to top public education officials across the country, the Education Department said that funding for schools with high percentages of low-income students, known as Title I funding, was at risk pending compliance with the administration’s directive. The memo included a certification letter that state and local school officials must sign and return to the department within 10 days, even as the administration has struggled to define which programs would violate its interpretation of civil rights laws. The move is the latest in a series of Education Department directives aimed at carrying out President Trump’s political agenda in the nation’s schools. At her confirmation hearing in February, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said schools should be allowed to celebrate the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But she was more circumspect when asked whether classes that focused on Black history ran afoul of Mr. Trump’s agenda and should be banned. “I’m not quite certain,” Ms. McMahon said, “and I’d like to look into it further.” More recently, the Education Department said that an “assessment of school policies and programs depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.” Programs aimed at recognizing historical events and contributions and promoting awareness would not violate the law “so long as they do not engage in racial exclusion or discrimination,” the department wrote.

"President Trump’s choice for solicitor general, D. John Sauer, has long pushed for restrictions on abortion and access to contraception.",2025-04-03,"The New York Times","Religious Charter School Challenge Advertisement Supported by President Trump’s choice for solicitor general, D. John Sauer, has long pushed for restrictions on abortion and access to contraception. By Abbie VanSickle Reporting from Washington When Chuck Hatfield, a lawyer in Missouri, showed up at a 2019 hearing to represent Planned Parenthood in its fight to keep a license for the state’s lone surgical abortion clinic, he was surprised to see a familiar face opposing him in the state’s solicitor general, D. John Sauer. It was an administrative hearing, not a high-stakes trial, but Mr. Sauer, Missouri’s top appellate lawyer, had not sent a deputy. Instead, he came to argue himself that Planned Parenthood’s license should not be renewed because of a handful of cases of complications resulting from abortions. Mr. Sauer lost the hearing, but he had come prepared for a fight. “He litigated the case aggressively,” Mr. Hatfield said. Mr. Sauer, 50, now President Trump’s selection to be the U.S. solicitor general — the top Justice Department official representing the federal government in arguments before the Supreme Court — first gained national attention last year when he represented Mr. Trump in his presidential immunity case. He presented a bold argument: A former president could be immune from prosecution even if he ordered SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival. That example elicited outcries at the time, but Mr. Hatfield said he found it typical of Mr. Sauer, a particularly assertive litigator for conservative causes for years, most notably abortion. “Other lawyers would perhaps not take the stretch positions, but John will go ahead and take them,” Mr. Hatfield said. On Thursday, the Senate confirmed Mr. Sauer, 52 to 45, putting him in charge of Mr. Trump’s aggressive attempt to get the Supreme Court to intervene in a series of cases in which lower court judges have temporarily blocked wide pieces of the administration’s agenda.

"Economists and legal experts question how the strongest economy in the world can be facing a national emergency over the trade deficit.",2025-04-03,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by Economists and legal experts question how the strongest economy in the world can be facing a national emergency over the trade deficit. By Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington President Trump upended the international trading system on Wednesday with a blunt package of global tariffs, making the case that the United States faces a dire economic emergency as a result of trade imbalances with countries across the globe. It’s a sentiment that Mr. Trump has expressed for decades, one that helped propel him to the presidency amid anger over lost manufacturing jobs and widening trade deficits. While the United States has the largest and strongest economy in the world, Mr. Trump — and many of his supporters — have long held the view that America has been ripped off by other countries and that tariffs are the answer to rectify decades of what they call unfair treatment that has shuttered factories, decimated communities and hurt workers. “Every prediction our opponents made about trade for the last 30 years has been proven totally wrong,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday, pointing to trade deals such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership as well as the tariffs he imposed during his first term. “We can’t do what we’ve been doing for the last 50 years.” Since his days as a real estate developer in the 1980s, Mr. Trump has been railing against the trade and business practices of other countries that he found to be unfair. Back then, when Japan was a booming economic rival, Mr. Trump used to assail its tactics. “If you ever go to Japan right now, and try and sell something, forget about it, Oprah. Just forget about it,” Mr. Trump said, in a 1988 interview with Oprah Winfrey, adding, “They come over here, they sell their cars, their VCRs, they knock the hell out of our companies.” This week he made good on his promise to try to force more companies to make their products in the United States. He punished trading partners with stiff tariffs, despite anxiety from economists, investors and businesses that his approach could send prices soaring and tip the economy into recession.

"Mr. Pappas, a 44-year-old Democratic congressman, is the first major candidate to enter the race to succeed the retiring Senator Jeanne Shaheen.",2025-04-03,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Mr. Pappas, a 44-year-old Democratic congressman, is the first major candidate to enter the race to succeed the retiring Senator Jeanne Shaheen. By Reid J. Epstein Reporting from Washington Representative Chris Pappas, a fourth-term New Hampshire Democrat, announced on Thursday that he would run for the Senate seat being vacated by the retirement of Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a fellow Democrat. Mr. Pappas, 44, is the first major candidate to enter the 2026 race. He began his campaign with a video that shows him being driven around New Hampshire and that casts him as a fighter ready to take on President Trump and Republicans — a nod, perhaps, to Democrats’ recent backlash against concessions made by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader. Voters, Mr. Pappas says in the video, “want someone who shows up, someone who listens and someone who isn’t afraid to take on the big fights — and, more importantly today, who knows how to win them.” His comments also represented a not-very-subtle shot at congressional Republicans, most of whom have avoided holding public meetings with constituents to discuss and defend the Trump administration’s actions. While New Hampshire elections are often close and a contest for an open Senate seat is likely to be an expensive and dogged affair, the race is not considered one of the most competitive in 2026. Democrats have held both of the state’s Senate seats since 2017. The party would need to flip four Republican-held seats in 2026 to take back control of the chamber. Other politicians who have publicly expressed interest in running for the New Hampshire seat include Representative Maggie Goodlander, a first-term Democrat who is the state’s other member of Congress; former Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican who served for eight years before declining to seek re-election last year; and Scott Brown, a Republican former Massachusetts senator who ran unsuccessfully for a New Hampshire Senate seat in 2014. In his announcement video, Mr. Pappas faintly echoes some of the arguments long made by a next-door neighbor, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont. “People, regardless of their politics, have a sense that the system is not working, that there are special interests and big corporations that have outsized influence in our political system,” Mr. Pappas says. “Everywhere we go, we hear it: veterans, parents, small-business owners, people who have done everything right asking, ‘Why does it feel like the system’s rigged?’” Such commentary explained a bit about the political moment Democrats find themselves in. Having been swept out of power last year as voters again demanded change, Democratic candidates for office in 2026 and beyond are branding themselves as agents of the next round of changes. This time, they are entertaining discussions of systemic shake-ups that were politically untenable for President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President Kamala Harris to campaign on last year. Should Mr. Pappas win a promotion to the Senate, he would become the chamber’s first openly gay male senator. The only mention of this potential bit of history comes at the conclusion of the announcement video, which shows Mr. Pappas and his husband sitting on a couch holding hands. Reid J. Epstein covers campaigns and elections from Washington. Before joining The Times in 2019, he worked at The Wall Street Journal, Politico, Newsday and The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

By Helene Cooper and John Ismay Reporting from Washington The Pentagon’s acting inspector general will review Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s disclosure on the Signal messaging app of the timing of U.S. fighter jets’ airstrikes against Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, the Defense Department’s watchdog agency announced Thursday. “The objective of this evaluation is to determine the extent to which the secretary of defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures for the use of commercial messaging application for official business,” the acting inspector general, Steven Stebbins, said in a notification letter to Mr. Hegseth. Mr. Stebbins started the review in response to a joint bipartisan request last week from Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and the committee’s ranking Democrat, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. The statement from Mr. Stebbins, who took over as acting inspector general after Mr. Trump’s firing of Robert Storch, notably called the review an evaluation and not an investigation. “Our evaluation will be objective, independent and thorough, and we will release the unclassified portions of our evaluation when it is complete,” said Mollie Halpern, a spokeswoman for the inspector general’s office. The difference, Ms. Halpern said, is that investigations may involve allegations of civil or criminal wrongdoing, while “evaluations” are focused more on operations, policies and programs.

"A letter from the administration promised to withdraw funding from schools that allow certain D.E.I. programs. But what counts as D.E.I. may prove murky.",2025-04-03,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by A letter from the administration promised to withdraw funding from schools that allow certain D.E.I. programs. But what counts as D.E.I. may prove murky. By Dana Goldstein What counts as a D.E.I. program in a school? And how do such programs differ from simply learning and talking about race and identity? Those questions have been central to local education debates over the past five years. Now, they are most likely to become even more pressing, after the Trump administration notified all 50 states on Thursday that public schools could lose federal funding if they engage in the use of D.E.I. to “advantage one’s race over another.” The letter presents the clearest threat yet to the country’s largest source of federal funding for K-12 schools — Title I, which supports low-income students. (Federal dollars account for about 8 percent of total K-12 education funding.) President Trump has previously pressured schools not to recognize transgender identities. The new directive focuses on the categories of race, color and national origin. The document sent to states cites Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which seeks to prevent discrimination, and the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision overturning affirmative action in college admissions. The administration has not offered many examples of K-12 programs it considers illegal. But here are the types of initiatives that could come under scrutiny. Schools sometimes separate students by race, either to provide targeted support or in an attempt to foster more open discussions about race itself.

By Devlin Barrett Reporting from Washington Justice Department officials will allow the actor Mel Gibson, a prominent supporter of President Trump, to own guns again, ending a once contentious debate that had roiled the upper ranks of the department, according to people familiar with the decision. Concerns over restoring Mr. Gibson’s gun rights led to a tense back-and-forth with the Justice Department’s pardon attorney, Elizabeth G. Oyer, shortly before she was fired by the Trump administration last month. The decision, which also applies to nine others, was approved by Attorney General Pam Bondi, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. The specifics are expected to be published in The Federal Register, they added. A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ms. Oyer previously said she had refused to recommend that Mr. Gibson be included on a short list of people with criminal convictions who could have their gun rights restored, despite pressure to do so from her superiors. She said in an interview with The New York Times after her firing that a department official had tried to convince her to change her mind because Mr. Gibson “has a personal relationship with President Trump.” Not long after that conversation, she and several other senior career lawyers at the Justice Department were abruptly terminated. A senior department official has denied that her dismissal was related to the disagreement about Mr. Gibson. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The judge, James E. Boasberg, said he was likely to wait until next week to rule on whether the White House was in contempt of court for having ignored his order.",2025-04-03,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The judge, James E. Boasberg, said he was likely to wait until next week to rule on whether the White House was in contempt of court for having ignored his order. By Alan Feuer A federal judge in Washington said on Thursday that there was a “fair likelihood” that the Trump administration had violated an order he issued last month to stop deporting Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law. Speaking at a hearing, the judge, James E. Boasberg, said that he was likely to wait until next week to issue a ruling about whether the White House was in contempt of court for having ignored his order. The announcement that he would delay a final decision came after he spent nearly an hour in a remarkable interrogation of a Justice Department lawyer. The tense hearing, in Federal District Court in Washington, was the latest turn in a dispute between Judge Boasberg and the Trump administration, which has repeatedly attacked him for having overstepped his authority by supposedly intruding on the president’s prerogative to conduct foreign affairs. A couple of weeks ago, Mr. Trump called for Judge Boasberg to be impeached. And in the days that followed, some of his top aides — chief among them, Attorney General Pam Bondi — have gone on television to accuse him, among other things, of being “out of control.” But during the hearing on Thursday, Judge Boasberg, a former homicide prosecutor, was anything but out of control. Adopting the tone of an inquisitor, he led the department lawyer, Drew Ensign, through a series of questions intended to determine whether the Trump administration had hurried the Venezuelan migrants onto planes and rushed them off the runway on March 15 in an effort to avoid his order stopping them. Judge Boasberg also grilled Mr. Ensign about a subject that was potentially even more sensitive: who in the administration knew about his order when it was handed down and who, if anyone, had given instructions for the planes transporting the migrants to El Salvador not to turn around.

By Anemona HartocollisAlan BlinderMichael C. Bender and Vimal Patel The Trump administration intends to block $510 million in federal contracts and grants for Brown University, expanding its campaign to hold universities accountable for what it says is relentless antisemitism on campus, according to two White House officials familiar with the plans. Brown became the fifth university known to face a potentially dire loss of federal funding, leaving other universities that the administration has targeted wondering when their turn might come. If the administration pauses $510 million, even over a period of years, the consequences for Brown could be significant. In its 2024 fiscal year, Brown received about $184 million through federal grants and contracts. In an email to campus leaders on Thursday, Brown’s provost, Frank Doyle, said the university was aware of “troubling rumors emerging about federal action on Brown research grants.” But he said that the university had “no information to substantiate any of these rumors.” The Daily Caller was the first to report the pause. The newly appointed secretary of education, Linda McMahon, has been explicit about the administration’s focus on elite universities, which Mr. Trump has criticized as bastions of left-wing thought. She has said that taxpayer support is a “privilege” that can be withdrawn if universities do not adhere to civil rights law. Like many of its Ivy League peers, Brown was the site of clashes over the war in Gaza. But it was also one of a small number of universities that made deals with students to end their protest encampments in the spring, agreements that came under criticism for being too soft on students.

By Zach Montague Reporting from Washington A federal judge on Thursday temporarily barred the Department of Health and Human Services from terminating a variety of public health funds that had been allocated to states during the Covid-19 pandemic, finding that the move had left those states stranded and unable to provide critical health services. Ruling from the bench during a hearing on Thursday, Judge Mary S. McElroy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island said a coalition of Democratic states had easily demonstrated that the cuts had upended their public health infrastructure and jeopardized everything from childhood vaccination programs to opioid addiction treatment almost overnight. On Tuesday, 23 states and the District of Columbia had filed a lawsuit pushing back against the Trump administration’s decision last week to cancel at least $11 billion in federal grants. The Trump administration had said that the funding was no longer necessary because the government’s pandemic emergency declaration had officially expired nearly two years ago. Starting on March 24, state agencies began receiving notices from the health department, bluntly informing them that the grants they had relied on for years to fight infectious disease and provide treatment for mental health and addiction had been suspended. “No additional activities can be conducted, and no additional costs may be incurred, as it relates to these funds,” the notices said. But some of the funding at issue was not scheduled to expire until as late as June 2027, and the states suing said that the abrupt and seemingly arbitrary termination had left them scrambling to fill a deep hole in their budget.

"After being picked up in Massachusetts, Rumeysa Ozturk was moved to a detention center in Louisiana, where the government wants to argue its case to deport her.",2025-04-03,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by After being picked up in Massachusetts, Rumeysa Ozturk was moved to a detention center in Louisiana, where the government wants to argue its case to deport her. By Anemona Hartocollis Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts student detained for pro-Palestinian activity, asked a federal judge in Boston on Thursday to have her case moved to Massachusetts, where she lives and was picked up by federal agents, from Louisiana, where she is being held in an immigration detention facility. Her lawyer, Adriana Lafaille, argued that after detaining Ms. Ozturk, the government deliberately moved her to a location where it could expect a more sympathetic hearing for its case against her. The transfer was so furtive that not even the government’s own lawyers knew where she was, Ms. Lafaille, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, told the court. Ms. Ozturk, a doctoral candidate, was detained on March 25 near her apartment in Somerville, Mass., by federal agents in plain clothes who surrounded her, cuffed her and drove her away in an unmarked S.U.V. Footage of the encounter, captured by a surveillance camera, was viewed by millions of people, and generated outrage that Ms. Ozturk, a Turkish citizen on a student visa, had been picked up off the street even though there were no charges against her. The government was “secretly whisking her away and making sure that no one would know where she was until she was in Louisiana,” Ms. Lafaille said, adding that she believed the government was “forum shopping” a location for the trial. (Louisiana is home to one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country.) She added that it was “quite unusual that even the government’s own lawyers” were not told where Ms. Ozturk was. A lawyer for the government said that Ms. Ozturk was moved out of state because there was no “bed space” at a detention center in Massachusetts to accommodate a female detainee.

"The president’s comment was a rare instance in which he and House Speaker Mike Johnson were not on the same side of an issue.",2025-04-03,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The president’s comment was a rare instance in which he and House Speaker Mike Johnson were not on the same side of an issue. By Annie Karni Reporting from Washington President Trump on Thursday threw his support behind a bipartisan effort to allow proxy voting for new parents in Congress, dealing a major blow to Speaker Mike Johnson’s attempts to kill the measure. “You’re having a baby, you should be able to call in and vote,” Mr. Trump told reporters flying to Florida with him aboard Air Force One. “I’m in favor of that.” The president’s endorsement of the plan came after he spoke with Representative Anna Paulina Luna, Republican of Florida, who has been pushing for a resolution that would allow lawmakers to vote remotely for up to 12 weeks after the birth of a child. There is no parental leave from voting for congressional lawmakers. And it appeared to force Mr. Johnson’s hand to make some concession to Ms. Luna, which he had previously been unwilling to do. On social media, Ms. Luna wrote that the speaker called her after Mr. Trump’s comment. “We discussed limiting the vote to just new moms who cannot travel because of health concerns,” she said. Ms. Luna appeared ready to compromise, as well. “This is smart,” she wrote, opening the door to an agreement on a policy that was more narrow than the one that a majority of House members had already said they would support. Ms. Luna has been leading the charge to allow proxy voting since she gave birth last year. She used a maneuver called a discharge petition — a demand signed by 218 members of the House, the majority of the body — to force consideration of the bipartisan measure to change the chamber’s rules.

"Kenneth D. DeGiorgio, the chief executive of First American Financial, was charged with assault.

DeGiorgio, the chief executive of First American Financial, was charged with assault. His lawyers say that the other man was harassing the executive’s wife. By Neil Vigdor The chief executive of a major U.S. title insurance company is facing a criminal charge over choking another passenger aboard a Caribbean cruise, an altercation that an investigator said began when the C.E.O.’s wife told the other man to put on his shoes while dancing at one of the ship’s bars, the F.B.I. said on Thursday. Kenneth D. DeGiorgio, the C.E.O. of First American Financial Corporation, which reported more than $6 billion in revenue last year and had more than 19,000 employees as of the end of 2024, was charged with assault, the authorities said. The confrontation occurred on March 31 aboard the Resilient Lady, an adults-only cruise ship operated by Virgin Voyages, which was about 70 nautical miles west of Fort-de-France, the capital of Martinique, according to a criminal complaint. Investigators said that the victim had told them that he was on the dance floor at one of the ship’s bars, On the Rocks, when Mr. DeGiorgio grabbed him by the neck and started choking him, which security camera footage corroborated. The man, whose identity was not revealed, said that Mr. DeGiorgio had threatened to kill him. The altercation began shortly after Mr. DeGiorgio’s wife had confronted the man about barefoot dancing, telling him, “Look, we are all grown-ups here — can you put your shoes on?” Mr. DeGiorgio’s wife told investigators that the man had made a crude remark to her, and the security video showed him giving her the middle finger, according to the F.B.I. The ship’s captain ordered Mr. DeGiorgio not to leave his stateroom until the cruise liner reached San Juan, Puerto Rico, its next port of call, the next day. Once there, he refused to answer F.B.I. agents’ questions and requested a lawyer, the authorities said. “Violent crimes committed aboard cruise ships fall under federal jurisdiction, and we take them very seriously,” Devin J. Kowalski, the acting special agent in charge of the F.B.I.’s San Juan field office, said in a statement on Thursday. “If you break the law at sea, expect to face consequences on land.” In a statement to The New York Times on Thursday, Mr. DeGiorgio’s legal team pushed back on allegations that he had been the aggressor. “Mr. DeGiorgio responded to the actions of an individual who harassed his wife, making her feel threatened and intimidated,” the statement said. “Although charged with a simple misdemeanor, Mr. DeGiorgio looks forward to being absolved of any wrongdoing.” Mr. DeGiorgio, who was released by the authorities and who lives near Los Angeles, faces up to one year in prison if convicted of the assault charge. Corporate filings show that Mr. DeGiorgio received nearly $7.8 million in total compensation in 2024 from First American Financial, a publicly traded company based in Santa Ana, Calif. The company, which provides title insurance and other financial services products, did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Nor did a representative for Virgin Voyages.

By Aishvarya Kavi and Edward Wong Aishvarya Kavi reported from outside the Wilson Center office in Washington. Edward Wong reports on U.S. foreign policy. Almost all the employees of the Wilson Center, a prominent nonpartisan foreign policy think tank in Washington, were placed on leave on Thursday and blocked from their work email accounts as Elon Musk’s task force quickly shut down most of the center. About 130 employees received orders telling them not to return to the office after the end of the day, according to an email reviewed by The New York Times and people with direct knowledge of the actions. The Wilson Center employees are to be paid while on leave but will be fired soon, in line with what has happened at other institutions that Mr. Musk’s workers have dismantled in recent weeks. Only five employees will remain — a president, two federal employees and two researchers on fellowships. Those positions are mandated in the center’s congressional charter. The cuts align with an executive order President Trump signed in March. Private donations to the center will be returned to the donors, according to a person familiar with the center who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution. It was not clear what would be done with the center’s endowment. On Thursday afternoon, dozens of employees carried boxes and bags filled with papers, plants and posters out of the center’s offices in the Ronald Reagan Building, which houses several government agency offices.

"After hail, heavy rains and more than 30 tornadoes drenched the region, officials warned that a “generational flooding” disaster was possible.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by After hail, heavy rains and more than 30 tornadoes drenched the region, officials warned that a “generational flooding” disaster was possible. By Mitch SmithAmanda Holpuch and Michael Levenson At least seven people have been killed in Tennessee, Missouri and Indiana, officials said on Thursday, after more than 30 tornadoes, combined with hail and heavy rains, swept through the South and Midwest, flooding streets, snapping power lines and flattening homes and businesses. The flooding was expected to worsen as the storm stalls over the region, putting millions under severe weather advisories over the next few days. Officials warned that a “generational flooding” disaster was possible as more than a foot of rain could fall, pushing swollen rivers and creeks over their banks. Cities and counties across the Midwest and South were ramping up efforts to prepare for the severe flooding that was predicted for the days ahead. Officials said that schools in some districts in Tennessee and Kentucky would be closed on Friday. The Army Corps of Engineers said it had filled about 1,500 sandbags to reinforce a levee near Poplar Bluff, Mo., where the Black River was expected to surge to near-record flood levels over the weekend. An urban search-and-rescue team was also deploying to the area. Gov. Mike Braun of Indiana said he was activating the National Guard to help with the storm response. As much as 10 to 15 inches of rain could fall through the weekend, the National Weather Service said. The most intense rain was expected in Arkansas and Tennessee, where floodwaters were rising in parts of Nashville and rescues were underway. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The discovery makes the Palisades and Eaton fires, combined, the second-deadliest wildfires in California’s history.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The discovery makes the Palisades and Eaton fires, combined, the second-deadliest wildfires in California’s history. By Jesus Jiménez Nearly three months after the January wildfires in Los Angeles, investigators discovered human remains in a burned lot on Wednesday in Altadena, Calif., raising the total death toll from the fires to 30. The Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office said a six-person team was sent to Altadena to investigate a report of possible remains. The team later confirmed the remains were human. The discovery came 12 weeks after the Eaton fire broke out on the evening of Jan. 7, burning more than 14,000 acres and destroying more than 9,000 structures. The remains found on Wednesday raised the death toll of the Eaton fire to 18 people. To the west in Pacific Palisades, 12 people died in the Palisades fire, which burned more than 23,000 acres and destroyed more than 6,000 structures. With their combined death toll at 30, the two fires make up the second-deadliest wildfire in California history. The Camp fire, which killed 85 people in Northern California in 2018, has the largest death toll in state wildfire history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Even separately, the Eaton and Palisades fires rank among the deadliest in California. The Palisades fire is the ninth deadliest and the Eaton fire is the fifth deadliest, according to state records. The death toll from the Eaton and Palisades fires could continue to grow. It was unclear how many people who were reported missing at the time of the fires were still missing. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department did not immediately provide an updated figure on Thursday. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"A father and two of his adult sons were hit by the train, officials said. Service between New York and Philadelphia was temporarily suspended.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by A father and two of his adult sons were hit by the train, officials said. Service between New York and Philadelphia was temporarily suspended. By Simon J. Levien Amtrak suspended service for several hours between Penn Station in New York and the main rail station in Philadelphia after one of its trains struck and killed a father and two of his adult sons in Bristol, Pa., on Thursday. The Bucks County coroner on Friday identified the three people as Christopher Cramp, 56, and David Cramp, 31, whose deaths were ruled as accidental, and Thomas Cramp, 24, who officials said died by suicide. All three died from multiple blunt impact injuries, the coroner said. The three were struck around 6:10 p.m. near Bristol Station, according to an Amtrak spokeswoman. The train was traveling from Boston to Richmond, Va. There were no reported injuries among the 236 passengers and crew members on the train, the spokeswoman added. The police were responding to a call around 5:58 p.m. that multiple people were on the train tracks, said Chief Joe Moors of the Bristol Borough police. As officers walked up the hill to the tracks, Chief Moors said, they saw the train hit all three people. Bristol is a small community about 20 miles northeast of Philadelphia. Train service resumed at restricted speeds between New York and Philadelphia about four hours later, Amtrak said. The suspension effectively halted traffic along the midpoint of the Northeast Corridor, the busiest train line in the country. Passengers on the train involved in the incident were moved to nearby train stations, either north to Tullytown or south to Croydon, Chief Moors said at a news conference on Thursday. This is the second fatal train strike in Bucks County this week. In neighboring Bensalem, Pa., on Wednesday, an Amtrak train traveling from Washington to Boston struck and killed a man near Cornwells Heights Station.

Harvard may have $9 billion on the line. By Michael C. Bender and Stephanie Saul The Trump administration sent Harvard a list of demands on Thursday that would have to be met to end a government review of $9 billion the school receives in federal funding. The government announced the review earlier this week, which threatened to cancel all or some of the money as part of its campaign against what it views as unchecked antisemitism on campuses. The conditions largely follow the playbook the Trump administration used to force Columbia University to comply with its demands last month, after canceling $400 million of that school’s federal grants and contracts. In both instances, the government asked Harvard and Columbia to impose bans, with few exemptions, on masking. Pro-Palestinian students often used masks during protests against the war in Gaza to obscure their identities after many said they were harassed online when their personal information was revealed. The Trump administration also pressured the universities to intensify efforts to hold student groups “accountable,” cease admissions practices based on race, color or national origin and revamp policies on campus protests. Harvard would also be required to “commit to full cooperation” with the Department of Homeland Security, the agency that enforces immigration policies, including deportations.

Timothy D. Haugh. The far-right activist Laura Loomer had called for his ouster in a meeting with President Trump, an official said. By Julian E. Barnes Reporting from Washington The head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command was removed from his job on Thursday, according to the top Democrats on the congressional intelligence committees. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut condemned the ouster of Gen. Timothy D. Haugh, who led both the spy agency and the military command. The move caught intelligence officials off guard. A spokeswoman for Cyber Command said she could not confirm General Haugh’s removal, and referred questions to the Pentagon, which did not respond to a request for comment. A White House spokeswoman did not confirm the ouster. But a U.S. official briefed on the matter said Laura Loomer, a far-right activist and outside adviser to President Trump, called for General Haugh’s removal during her Oval Office meeting on Thursday. Mr. Trump ordered Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to fire General Haugh, the official said. Ms. Loomer appeared to take credit for the firing, writing in a post on X after midnight that General Haugh “had no place” serving in the administration because he had been chosen for the job by Gen. Mark A. Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs who has been critical of Mr. Trump. “Why would we want an NSA Director who was referred to Biden after being hand selected by Milley,” Ms. Loomer wrote. “Why would we want Milley’s hand picked choice for NSA DIRECTOR?

By Eric SchmittEdward Wong and John Ismay Reporting from Washington President Trump said this week that Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen have been “decimated by the relentless strikes” that he ordered beginning on March 15. But that’s not what Pentagon and military officials are privately telling Congress and allied countries. In closed briefings in recent days, Pentagon officials have acknowledged that there has been only limited success in destroying the Houthis’ vast, largely underground arsenal of missiles, drones and launchers, according to congressional aides and allies. The officials briefed on confidential damage assessments say the bombing is consistently heavier than strikes conducted by the Biden administration, and much bigger than what the Defense Department has publicly described. But Houthi fighters, known for their resiliency, have reinforced many of their bunkers and other targeted sites, frustrating the Americans’ ability to disrupt the militia’s missile attacks against commercial ships in the Red Sea, according to three congressional and allied officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters. In just three weeks, the Pentagon has used $200 million worth of munitions, in addition to the immense operational and personnel costs to deploy two aircraft carriers, additional B-2 bombers and fighter jets, as well as Patriot and THAAD air defenses to the Middle East, the officials said.

By Minho Kim Reporting from Washington The Trump administration has failed to disburse congressionally approved funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the news network originally set up to counter Soviet propaganda during the Cold War, despite a judge’s order to keep it operating, according to court filings and officials at the news organization. The news group, known as RFE/RL, has not received nearly $12 million for its April funding from the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the federal entity overseeing it. The unusual delay in the disbursement has forced the news organization, which relies almost exclusively on congressional funding, to furlough some of its staff and cut parts of its programming. “We hope that U.S.A.G.M. sends our April funds immediately,” Benjamin Herman, the general counsel of the news group, said in a statement. “Our journalists across Europe and Asia, who assume enormous risk to work for RFE/RL, rely on the timely disbursement of these congressionally appropriated funds.” The U.S. Agency for Global Media also canceled satellite contracts for RFE/RL on Thursday, potentially hampering the delivery of Russian-language programs from the news outlet, according to two RFE/RL officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matters related to an ongoing lawsuit. Around 40 partner stations in Europe that broadcast Radio Free Europe’s live programs in Russian rely on satellites. In March, a federal judge in Washington temporarily halted President Trump’s efforts to shut down the news organization, ruling that his administration cannot unilaterally close a news group that Congress established by law. The judge, Royce C. Lamberth of the Federal District Court in Washington, wrote that “the continued operation of RFE/RL is in the public interest.” But Marney L. Cheek, a lawyer representing the news group, said in a court filing on Monday that Trump officials “have refused to commit to disbursing RFE/RL’s congressionally appropriated funds for April 2025.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

He plans to run in the general election in November, when ranked-choice voting is not in use.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","N.Y.C. Mayor’s Race Advertisement Supported by Democratic primary voters won’t see the mayor’s name on the ballot in June. He plans to run in the general election in November, when ranked-choice voting is not in use. By Maya King Mayor Eric Adams said on Thursday that he will skip the Democratic primary and run for re-election as an independent candidate, adding another unusual twist to an unpredictable mayoral campaign. His decision came one day after a judge dismissed the five-count federal corruption indictment against him, following pressure from the Justice Department under President Trump. In a six-minute video explaining his decision, Mr. Adams said he was still a Democrat. But he added that “this city is better served by truly independent leadership — not leaders pulled at by the extremists on the far left or the far right.” Mr. Adams faces a steep climb to another term. His approval rating has fallen to a record low, his threadbare campaign has raised little money and the leaders who were once his most ardent supporters have quietly backed away from him or abandoned him to support former Gov. Andrew Cuomo — who has a commanding lead over the Democratic primary field in his comeback bid for mayor. Mr. Adams will now spend the next several weeks gathering signatures to secure his place on the ballot as an independent. The primary election will be held on June 24, and the general election is on Nov. 4. Here is what to know about how the mayor’s decision could affect the mayoral primary. Nine Democrats are challenging Mr. Adams, though none are as close to unseating the mayor as Mr. Cuomo, whose ample name recognition and high-powered fund-raising have fueled his rise to the top of the primary field in nearly every survey of the race. Zohran Mamdani, a state assemblyman from Queens and a social-media-savvy democratic socialist who is building a base of new and younger voters, is the next highest-polling candidate. He is still well behind Mr. Cuomo. Other Democrats running in the primary include the city comptroller, Brad Lander; the City Council speaker, Adrienne Adams; the former comptroller, Scott Stringer, and the state senators Jessica Ramos and Zellnor Myrie. The Democratic primary has drawn an unusually large field of challengers seeking to seize on the unpopularity of the incumbent, Mayor Eric Adams, who plans to run as an independent.

"In some parts of the state, misdemeanor defendants routinely face charges without representation.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times"," In some parts of the state, misdemeanor defendants routinely face charges without representation. The Deaf Smith County Courthouse in Hereford, Texas.Credit... Supported by By Jolie McCullough Photographs by Ilana Panich-Linsman Jolie McCullough reported on failures of justice in rural parts of Texas as part of The Times’s Local Investigations Fellowship. San Jacinto County prosecuted nearly 300 misdemeanor cases in 2023. In this poor region, nestled in the piney woods of East Texas, many defendants were likely eligible for a government-paid lawyer. Yet the county reported it had provided an attorney to just nine people. Nearly 400 miles to the northeast, Wilbarger County, too, had about 300 misdemeanors that year. It assigned counsel to 15 defendants. And on the state’s far eastern edge, Shelby County, the poorest of the three, took on 307 cases. Nine defendants were granted court-appointed lawyers. The right to a criminal defense lawyer is so ingrained in the American idea of justice that fans of TV police dramas can recite these two lines from the Miranda rights by memory: You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. But in much of Texas, that right is routinely denied. Every year, more than half of rural Texans accused of misdemeanors are left to represent themselves — five times the rate of defendants in urban areas, according to estimates from the Texas Indigent Defense Commission, which is tasked by state statute with ensuring the right to an attorney is protected.

"As President Trump claims expansive and disputed powers, his administration has curbed the influential Office of Legal Counsel.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by As President Trump claims expansive and disputed powers, his administration has curbed the influential Office of Legal Counsel. By Charlie Savage Charlie Savage has been writing about presidential power and legal policy for more than two decades. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel has traditionally been a powerful guardrail in American government. It has issued interpretations of the law that bind agencies across the executive branch, decided which proposed policies were legally permissible or out of bounds and approved draft executive orders before they went to presidents to be signed. But in President Trump’s second term so far, the office has largely been sidelined. As Mr. Trump issues policy after policy pushing legal limits and asserting an expansive view of his power, the White House has undercut its role as a gatekeeper — delaying giving it senior leadership and weakening its ability to impose quality control over executive orders. Its diminished voice is shifting the balance of legal power in the executive branch toward the White House, speeding up Mr. Trump’s ability to act but creating mounting difficulties for the Justice Department lawyers who must defend the government in court. “The Trump administration has cut out the traditional check the Justice Department has played,” said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor who led the office under the George W. Bush administration. “O.L.C. being cut out is a piece of a larger strategy designed to ensure that the president can do whatever he wants, without any internal executive branch legal constraints on his will.” Two and a half months into his administration, Mr. Trump has neither submitted a nominee to be the office’s Senate-confirmed leader nor named an acting assistant attorney general. This week, after being asked to comment for this article, the department announced that he intended to nominate T. Elliot Gaiser, 35, the Ohio solicitor general, for the position.

"The 6,500-year-old weapons, found in a cave near Marfa, could be among the oldest near-complete set of wood and stone hunting tools found in North America.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The 6,500-year-old weapons, found in a cave near Marfa, could be among the oldest near-complete set of wood and stone hunting tools found in North America. By Livia Albeck-Ripka The 6,500-year-old hunting kit contained pieces of a spear thrower and a boomerang, as well as wood- and stone-tipped darts. It was found in a cave in West Texas near the remains of a small fire, and a pile of well-preserved human waste — evidence of those who had once sheltered inside. The weapons, discovered over the past several years near Marfa, a small desert town about 40 miles northwest of the border with Mexico, could be among the oldest near-complete sets of wood and stone hunting tools found in North America, according to archaeologists at Sul Ross State University and the University of Kansas. The researchers have yet to publish their full findings, but they said that dating suggested that one of the weapons was about 7,000 years old. The artifacts, researchers say, could help shed light on the complex ways in which ancient humans hunted for their prey and fixed their broken belongings. “We were just stunned, because I’ve never even seen that stuff,” said Bryon Schroeder, the director of the Center for Big Bend Studies at Sul Ross State University and one of the lead researchers on the project. The kit, which includes various pieces of weapons, as well as a folded antelope hide that was most likely used to sew a bag or clothing, was discovered over the past several years at the San Esteban Rockshelter — a partly collapsed cave between Marfa and Alpine, Texas. In 2019, researchers from the University of Kansas began excavations at the site in collaboration with Dr. Schroeder and his team. Looters have ransacked the site for years, Dr. Schroeder said, making it challenging to find an untouched area to dig in. The researchers crawled between rocks, eventually locating a spot where they believed they might still find some salvageable artifacts. “We quickly found out that it’s really, really, really deep in that part of the site,” Dr. Schroeder said. “The reason we were out there is to find really old stuff,” he added. “So we kept going deeper.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The Office of Legal Counsel issues opinions that are supposed to bind the executive branch. The Trump administration has taken steps and made claims in tension with several of them.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Office of Legal Counsel issues opinions that are supposed to bind the executive branch. The Trump administration has taken steps and made claims in tension with several of them. By Charlie Savage Charlie Savage has written about presidential power and legal policy for more than two decades. He reported from Washington. The Trump administration has taken steps and made claims that clash with legal opinions issued by a traditionally powerful agency that is part of the Justice Department, the Office of Legal Counsel. The office has typically had an influential role in shaping internal government legal deliberations, and its court-like opinions are supposed to bind the executive branch unless the attorney general or the president overrides them or the office itself revokes them. The disregard for its precedents is part of a broader pattern in which the clout and influence of the agency have eroded in the opening months of the administration. Here are some examples that show that disconnect. What the Trump administration has done The Trump administration has frozen large amounts of spending authorized by Congress. It has justified those blocks with shifting legal rationales in court. But both President Trump and his White House budget chief, Russell T. Vought, have said that they believe the president has constitutional authority to refuse to spend taxpayer money that Congress appropriated for things the president does not like. That tactic is called impoundment, and Mr. Trump and Mr. Vought have said that they intend to re-establish that power despite a 1974 law that largely banned it. What the Office of Legal Counsel has said An opinion from 1969, written by William H. Rehnquist before he became chief justice, says the “existence of such a broad power is supported by neither reason nor precedent.” The office reinforced that conclusion in a 1988 opinion that says “the weight of authority is against such a broad power in the face of an express congressional directive to spend.” What the Trump administration has done Mr. Trump signed an executive order declaring that babies born on domestic soil to undocumented parents are no longer eligible for birthright citizenship and instructing government agencies not to issue them citizenship-affirming documents like Social Security cards.

By Adam Goldman and Alan Feuer Adam Goldman reported from Washington, and Alan Feuer from New York. Before they took control of the F.B.I., the bureau’s two top leaders, Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, were some of the agency’s most rabid critics, attacking it at every turn for years. But now that they are running the agency, the two men have pulled a kind of bait-and-switch: In recent emails to thousands of F.B.I. employees, they have sought to use the bureau’s damaged reputation — a reputation that they themselves helped tear down — as a rationale for bringing reforms to the supposedly broken organization. “Over the past few years, the F.B.I.’s reputation has been damaged in the eyes of our employers, the American people,” Mr. Patel wrote on Wednesday in one of the messages. “I know each of you, serving across this great nation, are tackling cases that will further the betterment of the communities in which you live and work.” “Times of change can be uneasy, but they are necessary,” he went on. “Business as usual is no longer business as usual.” Absent from Mr. Patel’s communications with his 38,000 employees was any mention of the persistent assaults that he himself has launched against the F.B.I. over the years. Before he ascended to the post of F.B.I. director, Mr. Patel repeatedly distorted the facts about the bureau’s investigation of Russian meddling into President Trump’s 2016 campaign. He has also been a central purveyor of conspiracy theories, accusing federal agents of having helped instigate the attack by Mr. Trump’s supporters on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

"Immigration officers asked Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia if he was a gang member, and refused to believe him when he denied it, according to court papers.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Immigration officers asked Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia if he was a gang member, and refused to believe him when he denied it, according to court papers. By Alan Feuer The harrowing story of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia began six years ago on a March morning, when he dropped his pregnant girlfriend off at her job in suburban Maryland and made his way to a local Home Depot, hoping to find work as a casual day laborer. It took an even darker turn last month when Mr. Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old father and a Salvadoran migrant, was accused of belonging to a violent street gang. He was summarily deported to a Salvadoran prison — even though an American immigration judge had already decided he could remain in the United States, concerned he might be tortured in his homeland. What happened in between those events is now the subject of a fierce legal battle between his lawyers and the Trump administration, which acknowledged this week that his deportation on March 15 was an “administrative error.” Even after making the rare admission, the administration has effectively thrown its hands in the air, saying there is little it can do to retrieve Mr. Abrego Garcia from the brutal prison where it accidentally sent him. For now at least, there appear to be more questions than answers in the case. That could change on Friday, when a federal judge in Maryland is set to consider an emergency request by Mr. Abrego Garcia’s legal team. His lawyers are asking for an order that will force the White House to use whatever means it has at its disposal — diplomacy, money, even a simple phone call — to bring their client back to the United States. On Wednesday afternoon, the lawyers wrote to the judge, Paula Xinis, laying out the import of the case, not only for the man they represent, but for all migrants passing through the system.

"The president’s aides insist the fallout will be short and ultimately result in a better economy, as economists warn of higher inflation and slower growth.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The president’s aides insist the fallout will be short and ultimately result in a better economy, as economists warn of higher inflation and slower growth. By Tony Romm and Colby Smith Tony Romm reported from Washington, and Colby Smith from New York. In the weeks leading up to his expansive global tariffs, President Trump and his top aides tried to prime the public for economic pain. They warned that while there would be fallout from their aggressive trade strategy, it would prove short-lived and benefit the economy in the long run. Investors, businesses and others made clear on Thursday that the U.S. economy was not ready to accept that approach. Global markets tumbled, economists warned of a possible recession and consumers braced for price increases on cars, food, clothing and more. The early tumult underscored the high stakes of Mr. Trump’s agenda, which the president has framed as a painful medical procedure to rescue an economy he likened to a “sick patient.” In the eyes of Mr. Trump, the United States is going to “boom” once his tariffs have had time to reset the nation’s trade relationships, raise revenue and boost domestic production. But those tariffs are expected to send prices skyrocketing in the interim, an unwelcome development for Americans already struggling with years of elevated prices. Several economists have increased the odds of a recession in their forecasts as they projected a slowdown in consumer spending, business investment and economic growth. A new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab found that Mr. Trump’s overall tariffs could cause price levels to rise 2.3 percent in the short term. That would translate into an average loss of $3,800 in purchasing power per household based on 2024 dollars. “Prices are going to go up, period,” said Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Yale Budget Lab, adding that companies were going to feel the immediate pinch. “These are really big tariffs. These are not things we can expect companies to just absorb.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

More tornadoes were also possible. By Kevin WilliamsCarly GistAmy Graff and Rick Rojas Kevin Williams reported from Boston, Ky., and Medora, Ind.; Carly Gist from New Madrid, Mo.; and Rick Rojas from Memphis. Amy Graff is a weather reporter for The Times. Over the past few days, more than 30 tornadoes have shredded a vast stretch of the central United States, and relentless rain has pushed creeks and streams beyond their banks. In Kentucky, floodwaters swept away a 9-year-old boy, making him at least the eighth person killed by the violent series of storms. Officials in many storm-battered places beseeched residents on Friday to hunker down and stay vigilant, rather than begin assessing the destruction or cleaning up. The worst may be yet to come as a forecast of heavy rains with the potential for more tornadoes and floods extends through the weekend. “We have a lot of bad weather coming still,” Michael Mueller, the county judge and executive in Franklin County, Ky., said on Friday. “It’s very, very dangerous out there.” The storm had stalled on Friday over a region reaching from Arkansas to Michigan, places where residents and officials were painfully familiar with the perils and hardship that can come from tornadoes and overflowing waterway. Some Moderate High The reminders came as the death toll slowly climbed. In Tennessee, at least five people were killed by the storms, including a teenage girl, and several inches of rain that fell throughout Thursday caused major floods and shut down roadways.

"While Joe Biden was vice president, his son used the letterhead of a Ukrainian energy company when writing to a U.S. ambassador with ties to the family.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by While Joe Biden was vice president, his son used the letterhead of a Ukrainian energy company when writing to a U.S. ambassador with ties to the family. By Kenneth P. Vogel Kenneth P. Vogel has extensively investigated Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings. The State Department last week released a letter that Hunter Biden wrote while his father was serving as vice president in which he sought assistance from the U.S. government for the Ukrainian energy company Burisma. In the previously unpublished June 2016 letter on Burisma letterhead to the U.S. ambassador to Italy, Mr. Biden requested “support and guidance” in arranging a meeting with an Italian official to resolve regulatory hurdles to geothermal energy projects Burisma was pursuing in the Tuscany region. In a response letter also released by the State Department last week, the ambassador, John R. Phillips, indicated that he had dispatched a Commerce Department official to assist with the request. The letters shed more light on an episode The New York Times had previously revealed. Mr. Biden began his letter by referring to an interaction with the ambassador, writing, “It was great seeing you in Rome recently.” The letter did not mention then-Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., nor did it specify when Hunter Biden saw the ambassador in Rome. He had traveled there at least twice with his father in the preceding months. In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Phillips said that he did not view the letter as an effort to invoke the elder Mr. Biden in order to compel the embassy to help Burisma. Rather, Mr. Phillips said, he interpreted it as a reference to a Biden family trip to Rome over the Thanksgiving holiday in 2015, during which the younger Mr. Biden had spent time with the ambassador.

"A woman detained by U.S. border officers for overstaying a visitor visa died by suicide while in custody, according to a Democratic congresswoman.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by A woman detained by U.S. border officers for overstaying a visitor visa died by suicide while in custody, according to a Democratic congresswoman. By Isabella Kwai A Chinese woman detained by U.S. border officers for overstaying a visitor visa died by suicide while being held at a border patrol station in Arizona, a Democratic congresswoman said. The woman had been taken into custody in California after officers determined that she had overstayed a visitor visa, Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington said in a statement, citing the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. She was transferred to a patrol station in Yuma, Ariz., the statement said. Ms. Jayapal, a ranking member of the House subcommittee overseeing immigration, said initial reports from the agency had raised concerns about whether officers had properly conducted welfare checks on the woman. While welfare checks were logged, officials at the agency investigating the death could not verify whether the checks had actually happened, Ms. Jayapal said. “There is no excuse for why agents cannot verify if some of the necessary welfare checks occurred — or why some of the documented welfare checks were incorrectly reported,” Ms. Jayapal said, adding that she was concerned about the conditions in facilities where immigrants are detained. “Another preventable death only increases that concern,” she said. The woman had been in the country on a B-1/B-2 visa, according to the statement, a temporary visa for people visiting the United States for tourism or business. “All in-custody deaths are tragic, taken seriously, and are thoroughly investigated by C.B.P.,” a spokesman for the agency said in a statement on Friday, adding that the agency was investigating the woman’s death.

"Labor unions are battling the Trump administration over its attempts to slash the federal work force and roll back the protections afforded to the civil service employees.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Labor unions are battling the Trump administration over its attempts to slash the federal work force and roll back the protections afforded to the civil service employees. By Rebecca Davis O’Brien A group of federal employee unions filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the Trump administration’s efforts to strip union representation from about one million federal workers, arguing that President Trump had exceeded his constitutional authority and violated the unions’ rights. The complaint, filed late Thursday night in federal court in Oakland, Calif., is the latest development in the unions’ escalating battle with the administration over its attempts to slash the federal work force and roll back the protections afforded to the civil service employees. Unions representing government workers have repeatedly sued over the efforts to cut jobs and dismantle offices and agencies, winning at least temporary reprieves in some of those cases. Last week, Mr. Trump signed an executive order designating employees of about two dozen agencies as central to “national security missions,” a move explicitly designed to exclude them from federal unions, which the administration said were “hostile” to his agenda. The executive order was accompanied by a lawsuit in federal court in Texas, filed by the administration, seeking to allow federal agencies to cancel collective bargaining agreements. That would strip the employees of union protection and the unions of millions of dollars in dues. Officials at the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal union, which filed the countersuit on Friday, said the president’s move was among the most aggressive they had seen out of the White House so far, one that threatened collective bargaining rights across the work force. The A.F.G.E. alone represents 800,000 workers. The lawsuit called the order an act of retaliation against the union for pushing back against “both his agenda to decimate the federal work force and his broader agenda to fundamentally restructure the federal government through expansive and unprecedented exercises of executive authority.” Since January, unions have filed an array of lawsuits challenging an array of executive orders and actions, including the February firing of some 25,000 probational employees. The administration said the move to eliminate union representation was necessary to protect national security and advance Mr. Trump’s agenda.

"A law student in Florida has a lucrative side gig: fund-raising consultant. His firm earns a 25 percent cut of “profit” from donations, and critics have begun to pile up after two special elections.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Elections Advertisement Supported by A law student in Florida has a lucrative side gig: fund-raising consultant. His firm earns a 25 percent cut of “profit” from donations, and critics have begun to pile up after two special elections. By Shane Goldmacher After the Democratic candidates in Florida’s special elections burned through millions and millions of dollars on the way to double-digit losses this week, some Democrats are asking where that money deluge came from — and where it all went. The answer to both questions is, in part, a 23-year-old law student and dungeon master — in Dungeons & Dragons — with a lucrative side gig. In between classes and fantasy play, Jackson McMillan is also the chief executive of Key Lime Strategies, a small fund-raising firm in Florida that scored big when it landed as clients the two Democratic nominees in the Florida congressional elections, Josh Weil and Gay Valimont. Mr. McMillan said they had combined to raise $25 million. “We’ve built a juggernaut,” he said in an interview. Along the way, Mr. McMillan has piled up critics far beyond his years. Much of the focus is on his unusual fee structure, which one top party official excoriated in a cease-and-desist letter as “exorbitant.” His firm received a 25 percent cut of “true profits” — the proceeds after fund-raising expenses — for both special elections. Mr. McMillan is unapologetic. “A lot of the people who are critiquing me online are mad that it wasn’t them,” he said of raising so much money, which he said put a scare into Republicans and injected real money into long-neglected corners of a rightward-drifting state. One secret ingredient to his firm’s success, Mr. McMillan explained, is Dungeons & Dragons. “All the senior fund-raising strategists at my firm — myself, Ryan — we’re dungeon masters,” he said of his college friend and the firm’s chief operating officer, Ryan Eliason. “We run Dungeons & Dragons games. So we weave narratives and tales. It’s like our biggest hobby. We basically tell a really compelling story. And that’s what sets us apart from — that and a lot of technical analysis — is what sets us apart from some of our competitors.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The governor’s announcement could ratchet up animosity between the Trump administration and California, the world’s fifth-largest economy.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The governor’s announcement could ratchet up animosity between the Trump administration and California, the world’s fifth-largest economy. By Laurel Rosenhall Gov. Gavin Newsom of California is trying to get around President Trump’s tariffs to protect trade in a state with the world’s fifth-largest economy, asking his administration on Friday to pursue new international trade deals to exempt California products from any retaliatory tariffs. Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, called on foreign governments to exclude items made in California from any actions they take in response to the tariffs Mr. Trump announced this week. “Donald Trump’s tariffs do not represent all Americans, particularly those I represent here in the fifth largest economy in the world, the state of California,” Mr. Newsom said in a video announcement. “California is a stable trading partner and we hope you remember that as you consider California-made products.” California is the nation’s largest agricultural producer and home to the most Fortune 500 companies in the country. It exported $23.6 billion in agricultural products in 2022, with almonds, dairy products, pistachios, wine and walnuts making up the top exports. The Newsom administration also fears that retaliatory tariffs from countries that provide construction supplies, including timber, steel and aluminum, could hamper rebuilding in Los Angeles after January’s devastating wildfires. Mr. Newsom announced the plan early Friday in a news release and a brief video that did not dive into the details about how California’s separate trade deals might work. He sent a similar announcement to the email list he uses for political fund-raising. “The trade war that Donald Trump has launched is going to be felt in pretty profound ways to real people, including those who voted for Donald Trump and are now being betrayed by this very administration,” the email read.

The case has tested the boundaries of post-election litigation. By Eduardo Medina and Nick Corasaniti Eduardo Medina reported from Durham, N.C., and Nick Corasaniti from New York. In the prolonged legal battle over a North Carolina Supreme Court seat, a state appeals court panel ruled on Friday that tens of thousands of voters must promptly verify their eligibility or have their ballots thrown out. The decision could lead to the results of the November election being overturned. The ruling was a win for Judge Jefferson Griffin, a Republican who narrowly lost the election in November and challenged the result. His opponent, Justice Allison Riggs, is one of two Democrats on the seven-member Supreme Court. The case has tested the boundaries of post-election litigation and drawn wide criticism. Judge Griffin’s legal argument centers on a claim that about 65,000 people who cast their ballots in the election were ineligible to vote, mostly because they did not provide proof of identity — either the last four digits of a Social Security number or a driver’s license number — when they registered. There is evidence in court filings, however, that many of those voters did provide that information, but for several reasons — name changes after marriage, key-punching mistakes — they never appeared in the database. Although the omissions were no fault of the voters, Judge Griffin has argued, they left the voters’ eligibility in question. He has said that their ballots should be thrown out unless they provide legitimate proof of identity within a limited period of time set by the state. Two Republican judges on the North Carolina Court of Appeals, John Tyson and Fred Gore, agreed with Judge Griffin in the majority opinion for the three-judge panel, arguing that even one unlawful vote essentially “disenfranchises lawful voters.” They ruled that the voters in question “should be allowed a period of 15 business days after notice to cure their defective registrations.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Some Republicans are uneasy that their party is pursuing a tactic that could weaken the filibuster and backfire in the future.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Some Republicans are uneasy that their party is pursuing a tactic that could weaken the filibuster and backfire in the future. By Carl Hulse Reporting from the Capitol Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, has made preserving the institution of the Senate his signature issue since Day 1. And in his inaugural speech as leader in January, he called the filibuster “the Senate rule that today has perhaps the greatest impact on preserving the founders’ vision of the U.S. Senate.” But as he maneuvers to push through President Trump’s domestic agenda, including a huge tax cut, he is making an end run around the filibuster through procedural sleight of hand, alarming members of both parties. Concern about the move among Republicans slowed the start of a heated debate this week on the G.O.P. budget plan, and could present a serious impediment to passing the tax and spending cuts the president and congressional Republicans are seeking. “The question that I have is, does this take us to a place where we have eroded that aspect of the rule that has really kept us upright?” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said. She was one of a group of Senate Republicans who pressed their leaders on Thursday for a better explanation of what their budget approach meant for the filibuster they have vowed to defend. At issue is the Republican use of a complex process known as budget reconciliation to try to deliver trillions of dollars in tax cuts later this year. The process has been used extensively by both parties when they control Congress and the White House. It is the only way to shield major legislation from a filibuster, which requires 60 votes to overcome, and allow it to move through the Senate on a simple majority vote. But the exception is intended to be narrow. In exchange for filibuster protection, lawmakers must follow a rigorous set of budgetary rules meant to ensure that the legislation in question will not add to the deficit. The Senate parliamentarian is in charge of interpreting and enforcing those rules, and ordering lawmakers to strip out any provisions that do not comply. But this year, Senate Republicans are saying they will rely on their own interpretation of the budget rules where it concerns their tax cut plans, sidestepping the parliamentarian altogether.

"An attorney general in one of those states said the Trump administration was upending “the promise of progress for future generations.”",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by An attorney general in one of those states said the Trump administration was upending “the promise of progress for future generations.” By Soumya Karlamangla and Benjamin Mueller California, Massachusetts and 14 other states sued the Trump administration on Friday for withholding grant funding from public health and medical research institutions, cuts that have forced universities to curtail research and to delay the hiring of new staff. The National Institutes of Health is the world’s leading public funder of biomedical research, supporting studies on aging, substance abuse and other major issues. More than 80 percent of the agency’s $47 billion budget goes to outside researchers — grant funding that in recent weeks has been eliminated, paused or delayed by the Trump administration in a “concerted, and multi-pronged effort to disrupt NIH’s grants,” according to the lawsuit. Cuts and delays to N.I.H. funding have crippled research teams in universities across the country and halted studies midstream, setting back work on diseases like cancer and diabetes and plunging American medical research into crisis. The attorneys general are asking the courts to restore pulled grant funding and to allow pending grant applications to be evaluated and approved fairly. “In their unlawful withholding and terminating of medical and public health research grants, the Trump Administration is upending not only the critical work being done today, but the promise of progress for future generations,” Rob Bonta, the attorney general of California, said in a statement. Neither the National Institutes of Health nor the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the agency, responded to requests for comment. The massive University of California system — which conducts nearly 9 percent of all U.S. academic research, through both its undergraduate campuses and academic medical centers — gets half of its funding from the federal government. The university system last fiscal year received $2 billion in N.I.H. contracts and grants, according to the lawsuit. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Aishvarya Kavi and Alan Feuer Aishvarya Kavi reported from Greenbelt, Md., and Alan Feuer from New York. A federal judge gave the Trump administration until the end of Monday to return to the United States a Maryland man who was inadvertently deported to El Salvador last month despite a court order allowing him stay in the country. In a brief ruling issued on Friday, the judge, Paula Xinis, said that federal officials had acted without “legal basis” last month when they arrested the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, and put him on a plane — with no due process — to a notorious Salvadoran megaprison. The decision by Judge Xinis, which came during a hearing in Federal District Court, was a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration. In court papers filed this week, administration officials had said there was little they could do to get Mr. Abrego Garcia back from El Salvador, even after acknowledging that his deportation on March 15 had been a mistake. The judge’s ruling could put her on a collision course with the White House. President Trump and some of his top aides have repeatedly and aggressively attacked other federal judges who have questioned their attempts to carry out their deportation policies. Hours after the hearing on Friday, the Justice Department said that it intended to appeal the decision. The case of Mr. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant whose wife and three children are U.S. citizens, has become the latest flashpoint in a multifront battle between immigration lawyers and the White House, which has been ramping up deportations using both traditional and unusual methods.

And then there’s Eliot Tatelman of Jordan’s Furniture. While not well known outside New England, Mr. Tatelman has been a fixture for years on local television, hawking mattresses and sofas in humorous, relatively low-budget ads that made him one of the region’s instantly recognizable personalities, an avuncular pitchman with a ponytail guaranteeing “underprices.” Now, Mr. Tatelman is stepping away from his job, relinquishing his crown as New England’s king of couches. He announced this week that he was retiring as president of Jordan’s and that his sons, Michael and Josh, were taking over as the fourth generation of the family to run the furniture chain. They already serve as co-chief executives of the company, which is based in Dedham, Mass., and has 1,200 employees and eight stores in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Tatelman, 79, said he began thinking about retiring when his wife of 56 years, June, died in May. It made him think about “how fast and precious life is,” he said.

"Immigrant groups and Democratic states pushed back on a Trump administration request for the Supreme Court to allow curbs on birthright citizenship to go into effect in some places.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Immigrant groups and Democratic states pushed back on a Trump administration request for the Supreme Court to allow curbs on birthright citizenship to go into effect in some places. By Abbie VanSickle Reporting from Washington Immigrant groups and leaders of 22 Democratic-led states pushed back sharply on Friday against the Trump administration’s request that the Supreme Court lift a temporary nationwide ban blocking the president’s order to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and foreign residents. The filings in a trio of emergency applications came in response to the Trump administration’s emergency applications to the court in March, when the government asked the justices to step in and lift the block imposed by lower courts. On his first day in office, President Trump declared that citizenship would be denied to babies who do not have at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident. That would include children born to people who crossed into the country without permission. A brief filed by the immigrant advocacy groups said Mr. Trump had tried to end birthright citizenship by “executive fiat.” “But birthright citizenship is at the core of our nation’s foundational precept that all people born on our soil are created equal, regardless of their parentage,” the brief said. Three federal courts, in Massachusetts, Maryland and Washington State, have blocked the order while litigation proceeds. The birthright citizenship case is one of a number of legal battles around Trump administration policies before the justices. The court has also been asked to weigh in on the government’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport more than 100 Venezuelan migrants to a prison in El Salvador, as well as the cancellation of millions of dollars in teacher-training grants that it contends would promote diversity, equity and inclusion, and the firing of federal workers.

"The justices allowed the Trump administration to temporarily suspend $65 million in teacher-training grants, which helped place teachers in poor and rural areas.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The justices allowed the Trump administration to temporarily suspend $65 million in teacher-training grants, which helped place teachers in poor and rural areas. By Adam Liptak and Abbie VanSickle Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court on Friday let the Trump administration temporarily suspend $65 million in teacher-training grants that the government contends would promote diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, an early victory for the administration in front of the justices. The court’s order was unsigned, which is typical when the justices act on emergency applications. The temporary pause will remain in effect while the case is appealed. The decision was 5 to 4, with five of the court’s conservatives — Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil M. Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Brett M. Kavanaugh — in the majority. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voted with the court’s three liberal justices in dissent. The order came in response to one of a series of emergency requests by the Trump administration asking the justices to intervene and overturn lower court rulings that have temporarily blocked parts of President Trump’s agenda. The grants at issue in the case helped place teachers in poor and rural areas and aimed to recruit a diverse work force reflecting the communities it served. In February, the Education Department sent grant recipients boilerplate form letters ending the funding, saying the programs “fail to serve the best interests of the United States” by taking account of factors other than “merit, fairness and excellence,” and by allowing waste and fraud.

"With Republicans driving toward a vote on their tax and spending cut blueprint, Democrats are forcing them to cast politically painful votes on every element of President Trump’s agenda.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by With Republicans driving toward a vote on their tax and spending cut blueprint, Democrats are forcing them to cast politically painful votes on every element of President Trump’s agenda. By Catie Edmondson and Andrew Duehren Reporting from the Capitol The Senate plunged into a political showdown over President Trump’s domestic agenda that began Friday night and crept into Saturday morning, as Democrats forced dozens of votes during an overnight session to protest Republicans’ push to deliver “one big beautiful bill” of spending and tax cuts. The G.O.P. needs to pass its budget blueprint to unlock a process called reconciliation, which allows lawmakers to fast-track budget legislation through Congress and shield it from a filibuster. Disagreements between Republicans in the House and the Senate about what should be in that bill had paralyzed them for weeks, but they have forged a fragile and complex compromise allowing them to move forward. “This resolution is the first step toward a final bill to make permanent the tax relief we implemented in 2017 and deliver a transformational investment in our border, national and energy security,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader. He added later, “Let’s let the voting begin.” But in the Senate, members can offer an array of amendments to budget measures in a ritual known as a “vote-a-rama,” a marathon of rapid-fire votes that often stretches throughout the night. The proposals will never become law, but the process allows the minority party to force a series of politically fraught votes that can be used against lawmakers in campaign advertisements later. Democrats said they planned to spend the marathon session forcing Republicans to weigh in on a series of amendments protesting Mr. Trump’s escalating global trade war, Elon Musk’s cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, the G.O.P.’s proposed cuts to Medicaid and the recent use of Signal by national security officials in the Trump administration. “Our amendments will give Republicans the chance to join us in hitting the kill switch on Donald Trump’s tariffs, on DOGE, on the attacks against Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said on Friday night minutes before voting started. “Republicans could snuff it out instantly tonight if they wanted.

But now, in his second term, he has fewer people around him who try to keep those voices away. By Jonathan SwanMaggie Haberman and Ken Bensinger Reporting from Washington Laura Loomer had President Trump’s full attention. Sitting directly across from the president in the Oval Office, Ms. Loomer, the far-right agitator and conspiracy theorist, held a stack of papers that detailed a litany of accusations about “disloyal” members of the National Security Council. The national security adviser, Michael Waltz, had arrived late and could only watch as Ms. Loomer ripped into his staff. Fire them, Mr. Trump instructed Mr. Waltz, according to people with knowledge of the meeting on Wednesday. The president was furious and demanded to know why these people had been hired in the first place. The events of Wednesday and Thursday, with more than a half-dozen national security officials fired on the advice of Ms. Loomer, unsettled even some veteran Trump officials. But the situation perfectly encapsulates Mr. Trump’s longtime penchant for soliciting information from dubious sources. The difference now, in Mr. Trump’s second term, is that he has fewer people around him who try to keep those voices away. In a social media post on Friday, Ms. Loomer explained why two of the people who lost their jobs this week were on her list. Gen. Timothy D. Haugh, the head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, had been chosen by Gen. Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whom Ms. Loomer called a traitor. And General Haugh’s deputy, Wendy Noble, was close to James Clapper, a former director of national intelligence and fierce critic of Mr. Trump. People close to General Haugh said he did not know how he ended up in Ms. Loomer’s cross hairs. He was traveling in Japan when the Pentagon told him that his “services would no longer be needed,” without any further explanation, according to two former U.S. officials.

By Carol Rosenberg Carol Rosenberg has been reporting on U.S. military activities at the Navy base in Cuba since 1999. Two months after President Trump ordered his administration to prepare the U.S. Navy base at Guantánamo Bay for up to 30,000 migrants, about 400 migrants have been held there at a cost to taxpayers of more than $40 million. At one point in February, the administration held 178 Venezuelans at the base, the largest group to be kept there at one time. The operation has been staffed with 1,000 government workers, 900 of them members of the U.S. military and the rest immigration service agents or contractors. That means a ratio of five staff members for each migrant in that group. Senior Pentagon officials testified at Congress this week about the operation. Here are some of the things we know as of now. No. To hold that many people there, the Pentagon would have to mobilize approximately 9,000-plus service members to Guantánamo to support the Immigration and Customs Enforcement staff running the operation, Adm.

"The student, Rumeysa Ozturk, was detained by ICE agents in Massachusetts, driven to Vermont and flown to a detention center in Louisiana, where the government was trying to argue her court case.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by The student, Rumeysa Ozturk, was detained by ICE agents in Massachusetts, driven to Vermont and flown to a detention center in Louisiana, where the government was trying to argue her court case. By Anemona Hartocollis A federal judge ordered Friday that the case to free Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts student from Turkey, from immigration detention should be moved to a court in Vermont, denying a government demand to hold the proceedings in Louisiana, where she is being held. Ms. Ozturk, a legal resident on a student visa, was swept up by the government as part of what the Trump administration has described as a campaign against antisemitic activists on campus. In a hearing on Thursday, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that the government had stealthily transferred her from Massachusetts, where she was arrested, to Louisiana without informing her lawyers where she was. The lawyer, Adriana Lafaille, suggested the government was seeking a court that would favor its case. Louisiana has one of the most conservative appeals courts in the country. Government lawyers told the court that Ms. Ozturk had been moved to Louisiana because there was not an available bed for a female detainee in New England, and that there was no intent to withhold information about her location. In her ruling on Friday, Judge Denise Casper of U.S. District Court in Boston, said that Vermont was the proper venue because Ms. Ozturk was being held there overnight at the time that her lawyers — not knowing where she was — filed a petition for her release in Boston. Normally, a petition to free someone would be filed in the jurisdiction where the person was confined. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Shawn Hubler Los Angeles County has agreed to pay a staggering $4 billion to settle sex abuse claims from generations of children in its juvenile detention and foster care systems in what lawyers said would be the largest payout of its kind in U.S. history. The sweeping agreement, announced Friday, was the latest in a wave of settlements precipitated by a five-year-old state law that dramatically expanded the number of child sexual abuse lawsuits filed against municipalities and school districts. The settlement is expected to be formally approved over the next two weeks by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and the county’s claims board, covering more than 6,800 claims of childhood sexual abuse that date as far back as 1959. County officials have warned that the amount of the settlement will likely lead to budget cuts. Most of the cases stem from abuse allegations that occurred in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s at probation and foster care facilities, county officials said. A significant number took place at the MacLaren Children’s Center, a county-run children’s shelter that operated for 42 years east of downtown Los Angeles in the city of El Monte. Opened in 1961 as a temporary foster home, MacLaren permanently closed in 2003 amid lawsuits that claimed severe mistreatment of children. A civil grand jury report at the time found that MacLaren managers had allowed convicted burglars and drug traffickers to care for children and had not checked the criminal background of employees for decades. In subsequent lawsuits, former residents said staff members had crawled into their bunks at night and sexually assaulted them, punishing them if they reported the abuses. Some said they had been as young as 5 at the time. “On behalf of the county, I apologize wholeheartedly to everyone who was harmed by these reprehensible acts,” the county’s chief executive, Fesia Davenport, said in a statement on Friday. “The historic scope of this settlement makes clear that we are committed to helping the survivors recover and rebuild their lives — and to making and enforcing the systemic changes needed to keep young people safe.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The potential for major penalties in the European Union could test the boundaries of online speech and inflame tensions between the U.S. and Europe.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Newsletter The potential for major penalties in the European Union could test the boundaries of online speech and inflame tensions between the U.S. and Europe. By Kate Conger Elon Musk’s close relationship with President Trump may well end up shielding him from the 32 continuing investigations, pending complaints or enforcement actions against his companies in the United States. But something else appears to be happening for Musk in Europe. My colleague Adam Satariano got the scoop last night that X, Musk’s social media platform, is likely to face major penalties in Europe for violating a new law designed to combat illegal content and disinformation. The company is expected to face a significant fine and orders to change its service. The investigation could complicate Musk’s agenda to make X a hub of freewheeling conversation, where anything goes. It has already inflamed simmering disagreement between the United States and Europe over online speech. I asked Adam to explain how things got to this point, and how Europe is likely to handle its case against X, given Musk’s ties to Trump. KC: You wrote that online speech has become a fractious issue between Europe and the United States. How did it get this way? AS: It goes back decades but has intensified under the Trump administration. Europe has long adopted more limits on speech — think Germany’s restrictions on Nazism — while America prioritizes personal freedoms over all else, except perhaps being able to yell, “Fire!” in a crowded theater. As with many things, the internet, including social media, has made the differences in approach more pronounced, and turned them into a geopolitical pressure point.

"New York’s stance differed from the muted and deferential responses from other major institutions to the administration’s threats.",2025-04-04,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by New York’s stance differed from the muted and deferential responses from other major institutions to the administration’s threats. By Troy Closson The New York State Education Department on Friday issued a defiant response to the Trump administration’s threats to pull federal funding from public schools over certain diversity, equity and inclusion programs, a remarkable departure from the conciliatory approach of other institutions in recent weeks. Daniel Morton-Bentley, the deputy commissioner for legal affairs at the state education agency in New York, wrote in a letter to federal education officials that “we understand that the current administration seeks to censor anything it deems ‘diversity, equity & inclusion.’” “But there are no federal or state laws prohibiting the principles of D.E.I.,” Mr. Morton-Bentley wrote, adding that the federal government has not defined what practices it believes violate civil rights protections. The stern letter was sent one day after the federal government issued a memo to education officials across the nation, asking them to confirm the elimination of all programs it argues unfairly promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Title I funding for schools with high percentages of low-income students was at risk pending compliance, federal officials said. New York’s stance differed from the muted and often deferential responses across academia and other major institutions to the Trump administration’s threats. Some universities have quietly scrubbed diversity websites and canceled events to comply with executive orders — and to avoid the ire of the White House. A divide emerged last spring as the presidents of several universities, including Harvard and Columbia, adopted cautious responses when confronted by House Republicans at congressional hearings regarding antisemitism. In contrast, K-12 leaders, including David C. Banks, chancellor of New York City’s public schools at the time, took a combative approach. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But he also offered a critique of campus culture, saying it had too often shut out opposing voices. By Vimal Patel Former President Barack Obama, in a campus speech on Thursday, urged universities to resist attacks from the federal government that violate their academic freedom. He also said schools and students should engage in self-reflection about speech environments on their campuses. “If you are a university, you may have to figure out, are we in fact doing things right?,” he said during a conversation at Hamilton College in upstate New York. “Have we in fact violated our own values, our own code, violated the law in some fashion?” “If not, and you’re just being intimidated, well, you should be able to say, that’s why we got this big endowment.” Mr. Obama’s comments came as the Trump administration has threatened universities with major cuts. It took away $400 million in grants and contracts from Columbia University in March. It later suspended $175 million to the University of Pennsylvania, and said this week that it was reviewing about $9 billion in arrangements with Harvard and its affiliates. At Harvard, where the university has made efforts to respond to Republican criticism and concerns from Jewish students and faculty, more than 800 faculty members have signed a letter urging their leadership to more forcefully resist the administration and defend higher education more broadly.

By John Ismay John Ismay reports on the Defense Department. Maya Angelou’s seminal autobiography, “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” and books on the Holocaust were included on the Navy’s list of 381 books that were removed from the U.S. Naval Academy’s Nimitz Library on the Annapolis, Md., campus this week because their subject matter was seen as being related to so-called diversity, equity and inclusion topics. President Trump issued an executive order in January that banned D.E.I. materials in kindergarten through 12th grade education, but the office of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth informed the Naval Academy on March 28 that he intended the order to apply to the school as well, even though it is a college.  The list also includes “Memorializing the Holocaust,” Janet Jacobs’s examination of depictions of women in the Holocaust, and “How to Be Anti-Racist” by Ibram X. Kendi. Also listed are “The Making of Black Lives Matter,” by Christopher J. Lebron; “How Racism Takes Place,” by George Lipsitz; “The Fire This Time,” edited by Jesmyn Ward; “The Myth of Equality,” by Ken Wytsma; studies of the Ku Klux Klan, and the history of lynching in America. The list also includes books about gender and sexuality, like “Bodies in Doubt: An American History of Intersex” by Elizabeth Reis, and “Between XX and XY: Intersexuality and the Myth of Two Sexes” by Gerald N. Callahan. President Trump issued a separate executive order in January proclaiming that there are only two sexes. The inclusion of Maya Angelou’s best-selling 1970 memoir was notable because it has long been viewed by Black women, and men, as transformative. The book, which spent two years on the New York Times best-seller list and was nominated for a National Book Award, chronicles her struggle with racism and trauma, including her account of a rape at the age of 7 by her mother’s boyfriend. Oprah Winfrey famously said that she had been moved to learn from the book that another Black girl had endured sexual abuse. “I read those words and thought, ‘Somebody knows who I am,’” she said. The Naval Academy began pulling books from the shelves at Nimitz Library on Monday evening and largely completed the task before Mr. Hegseth visited midshipmen on campus Tuesday afternoon.

By Zach Montague Reporting from Washington A federal judge permanently barred the Trump administration on Friday from limiting funding from the National Institutes of Health that supports research at universities and academic medical centers, restoring billions of dollars in grant money but setting up an almost certain appeal. The ruling by Judge Angel Kelley, of the Federal District Court in Massachusetts, made an earlier temporary order by her permanent and was one of the first final decisions in the barrage of lawsuits against the Trump administration. But it came about in an unusual way: The government asked the court to enter that very verdict earlier on Friday so it could move ahead with an appeal. The decision nonetheless was an initial win for a diverse assortment of institutions that conduct medical research. After the Trump administration announced the policy change in February, scores of research hospitals and universities issued dire warnings that the proposal threatened to kneecap American scientific prowess and innovation, estimating that the change could force those institutions to collectively cover a nearly $4 billion shortfall. Under the Trump administration’s plan, the National Institutes of Health could cap the funding it provides to cover the “indirect costs” of research — for things like maintenance of buildings, utilities and support staff — at 15 percent in the grants it hands out. Historically, when the agency awarded grants, it could allocate close to 50 percent in some cases to cover the indirect costs associated with a given study. The Trump administration said it had conceived of the policy as a way of freeing up more federal dollars to pay for research directly — covering scientists’ salaries or buying necessary equipment — as opposed to the many tangential costs that hospitals and laboratories incur in maintaining their facilities and other overhead expenses. But critics described that reasoning as disingenuous, as the changes the administration had proposed would paradoxically force institutions to cover the bill, and most likely shed staff and scale down research projects in the process.

By Catie Edmondson and Maya C. Miller Reporting from Washington The Senate approved Republicans’ budget blueprint just after 2:30 a.m. on Saturday to clear the way for passing President Trump’s domestic agenda, after Democrats forced an overnight session to protest the G.O.P. push to deliver what the president has called “one big beautiful bill” of spending and tax cuts. The 51-to-48 vote, mostly along party lines, was a crucial step in the Republican effort to fast-track budget legislation through Congress and shield it from a filibuster through a process known as reconciliation. Disagreements between Republicans in the House and the Senate about what should be in that bill had paralyzed them for weeks, but they have forged a fragile and complex compromise allowing them to move forward. Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine were the only Republicans who voted to oppose the measure. The budget blueprint goes next to the House, which must adopt it before lawmakers in both chambers can set to work drafting the legislation laying out the specific tax and spending cuts they want to enact. “This resolution is the first step toward a final bill to make permanent the tax relief we implemented in 2017 and deliver a transformational investment in our border, national and energy security,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, before the vote.

"The businessman has won supporters and detractors as he considers running for mayor or governor of California as Los Angeles rebuilds from the wildfires in January.",2025-04-05,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The businessman has won supporters and detractors as he considers running for mayor or governor of California as Los Angeles rebuilds from the wildfires in January. By Adam Nagourney and Shawn Hubler Adam Nagourney and Shawn Hubler are longtime California correspondents, covering state politics, government and culture. Hubler has reported on the last six Los Angeles mayors. Rick J. Caruso, the wealthy developer, spent $100 million to run for mayor of Los Angeles in 2022. After his decisive defeat, he stepped to the side of the public stage. But this year, in the weeks and months following the devastating January wildfires, Mr. Caruso has behaved almost as if he won that election. He has been cheerleading businesses trying to reopen, offering advice to homeowners looking for help in rebuilding and assailing the woman who defeated him, Mayor Karen Bass. As Ms. Bass has faced scrutiny over her response to the fires, Mr. Caruso — with a staff of consultants and a stream of top-quality videos — has sought to present himself as something of a shadow mayor, a business executive who can lead Los Angeles out of this crisis. “Hi everybody, it’s Rick Caruso, and I’ve got some great news for everybody,” he proclaimed the other day on Instagram, standing on a balcony overlooking the Grove, his high-end mall in Los Angeles. “We’ve got some small businesses that are reopening in the Palisades and Altadena.” In recent weeks, he has urged administrators to reopen schools that were destroyed by the fires, told homeowners where to go to ensure that the Army Corps of Engineers clears their property and urged people to patronize the few stores that have reopened amid the rubble. The commission of civic and business leaders he created in the days after the fires, called Steadfast LA, has made a show of raising money and proposing how to rebuild. In many cases, Mr. Caruso is pushing City Hall to take steps it has already taken: Los Angeles has already begun issuing fast-tracked building permits for the Palisades and led extensive campaigns informing people of how to get debris cleared. That Instagram post was put out hours after the mayor visited the same business whose opening he was lauding. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The firing of the head of the National Security Agency was only the latest move that has eroded the country’s fortifications against cyberattacks, especially those targeting elections.",2025-04-05,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The firing of the head of the National Security Agency was only the latest move that has eroded the country’s fortifications against cyberattacks, especially those targeting elections. By David E. Sanger and Nick Corasaniti David E. Sanger has written extensively on the intersection of national security and cyberweapons. Nick Corasaniti has covered election security for six years. When President Trump abruptly fired the head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command on Thursday, it was the latest in a series of moves that have torn away at the country’s cyberdefenses just as they are confronting the most sophisticated and sustained attacks in the nation’s history. The commander, General Timothy D. Haugh, had sat atop the enormous infrastructure of American cyberdefenses until his removal, apparently under pressure from the far-right Trump loyalist Laura Loomer. He had been among the American officials most deeply involved in pushing back on Russia, dating to his work countering Moscow’s interference in the 2016 election. His dismissal came after weeks in which the Trump administration swept away nearly all of the government’s election-related cyberdefenses beyond the secure N.S.A. command centers at Fort Meade, Md. At the same time, the administration has shrunk much of the nation’s complex early-warning system for cyberattacks, a web through which tech firms work with the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies to protect the power grid, pipelines and telecommunications networks. Cybersecurity experts, election officials and lawmakers — mostly Democrats but a few Republicans — have begun to raise alarms that the United States is knocking down a system that, while still full of holes, has taken a decade to build. It has pushed out some of its most experienced cyberdefenders and fired younger talent brought in to design defenses against a wave of ransomware, Chinese intrusions and vulnerabilities created by artificial intelligence. “At a time when the United States is facing unprecedented cyberthreats — as the Salt Typhoon cyberattack from China has so clearly underscored — how does firing him make Americans any safer?” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday night after General Haugh’s ouster. Mr. Warner was referring to an operation in which Chinese intelligence bored so deeply into American telecommunications networks that it had access to the Justice Department’s system for lawful interception of calls or text messages and could listen in on some conversations, including Mr. Trump’s during his campaign last year.

"Job and program cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services have teed up court challenges and prompted bipartisan criticism in Congress.",2025-04-05,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Job and program cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services have teed up court challenges and prompted bipartisan criticism in Congress. By Zach Montague and Sheryl Gay Stolberg Reporting from Washington A “policy lab” that generates ideas to improve mental health. An office that studies the effects of smoking. A team of scientists and public health experts who focus on birth defects. All three are programs in the Department of Health and Human Services that were created by Congress, which funds them. And all three have been hollowed out by mass layoffs at the agency ordered by President Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser leading the federal government’s cost-cutting efforts. Since Tuesday, when the layoffs began, lawmakers, medical associations, research universities and state health agencies have scrambled to sort out which jobs were eliminated, and how to respond. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has already admitted that some workers were mistakenly fired alongside nearly 20 percent of the agency’s work force, and has promised that they will be reinstated. The Republican chairman and top Democrat on the Senate health committee asked Mr. Kennedy to testify about the cuts next week, but it is not clear if he has accepted the invitation. One thing is clear: The layoffs and wholesale reorganization of the department are the latest in a series of Trump administration actions ripe for legal challenges. The administration has been on shaky ground, legal experts said, in dissolving agencies created and funded by Congress. Max Stier, the president of Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that promotes best practices in government, said that the administration had overstepped its authority.

Voters were bracing for the effects in their own lives, but some said they were, for now, waiting and watching to see how all of this plays out. — Campbell Robertson “I live in Trump country,” Hamid Chaudhry said. “Nobody is panicking.” The owner of a farmer’s market, he said he has taken a 25 percent cut in profits over the past year because of the rising costs of goods and services. He said he believed that in the next few months, the pain could run even deeper, so he was building up a rainy-day fund. But he was hopeful that the tariffs would eventually pay off, most likely by the next presidential election. “As a business owner, you don’t make money right away, right?” said Mr. Chaudhry, who voted for Mr. Trump. “When I listen to Trump, what he’s saying is, ‘It’s a short-term pain, but there’s the light at the end of the tunnel.’” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The rallies on Saturday are being held all over the country and emphasize cuts to health care, Social Security and education.",2025-04-05,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The rallies on Saturday are being held all over the country and emphasize cuts to health care, Social Security and education. By Katie Benner Reported from Washington Opponents of President Trump are planning protests on Saturday in all 50 states to oppose the president’s slash and burn attacks on federal health care programs, and government workers, a message that they say appeals to a politically diverse set of Americans. The mass action, “Hands Off!,” was organized by Indivisible, MoveOn and several other groups that led protests about abortion rights, gun violence and racial justice during the first Trump administration. But organizers said they are now working with 150 local, state and national partners to emphasize a new message: President Trump is threatening health care, Social Security and education, making life harder for the average American, while benefiting his richest friends. “We need to bring in new people, and that’s where Trump’s policies are so consequential,” said Britt Jacovich, a spokeswoman for MoveOn. Longtime Trump opponents are re-examining the huge protest movements that defined his first stint in office. The demonstrations minted new generations of activists and helped the Democrats retake the House in 2018, but they did not protect Roe v. Wade or compel Congress to pass police reform legislation. And in the end, Mr. Trump came roaring back in November and won the election. “The protests were effective in the short term, but in the longer term, unless there is some kind of resounding defeat politically, movements like Trump’s are able to reconstitute and, in this case, win,” said Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist who studies social movements and nonviolent resistance. Saturday’s protests will surely include signs and speeches about reproductive rights, trans rights and racial justice. In other ways, the events may bear little resemblance to the mass demonstrations in Mr. Trump’s first term, particularly the Women’s March on Washington, which set the tone for the resistance. The day after his inauguration, more than half a million pink-hatted protesters descended on the nation’s capital to watch Madonna perform and celebrities give keynote speeches, and millions more marched in cities nationwide.

"Gen. Timothy D. Haugh, who was also the head of U.S. Cyber Command, was one of several national security officials fired on the advice of a conspiracy theorist.",2025-04-05,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Gen. Timothy D. Haugh, who was also the head of U.S. Cyber Command, was one of several national security officials fired on the advice of a conspiracy theorist. By Julian E. Barnes Reporting from Washington As soon as word spread that President Trump had fired Gen. Timothy D. Haugh, the head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, current and former administration officials began floating theories about why he had been let go. Had General Haugh opposed one of Mr. Trump’s initiatives, perhaps moved too slowly on purging officers who had worked on diversity issues? Or was he a casualty of the administration’s shifting priorities to counter narcotics? Whether any of that was true, it had little, if anything, to do with why he was fired. General Haugh was ousted because Laura Loomer, a far-right wing conspiracy theorist and Trump adviser, had accused him and his deputy of disloyalty, according to U.S. officials and Ms. Loomer’s social media post early Friday. He was one of several national security officials fired this past week on her advice. “I predict you are going to see some nonsense statement about some policy difference or something General Haugh wasn’t doing, but we all know what happened,” said Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who is on the intelligence and armed services committees. “Laura Loomer said it. She is the one who told Trump to fire him.” Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and former majority leader, lamented that the Trump White House had ousted General Haugh and was appointing people to Pentagon posts who were skeptical of America’s engagement with allies and the world. “If decades of experience in uniform isn’t enough to lead the N.S.A. but amateur isolationists can hold senior policy jobs at the Pentagon, then what exactly are the criteria for working on this administration’s national security staff?” Mr. McConnell said. “I can’t figure it out.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Representative Rob Bresnahan Jr., who campaigned on prohibiting stock trading by members of Congress, has emerged as one of the most active stock traders in the freshman class.",2025-04-05,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Representative Rob Bresnahan Jr., who campaigned on prohibiting stock trading by members of Congress, has emerged as one of the most active stock traders in the freshman class. By Annie Karni Reporting from Washington Last March, when Rob Bresnahan, Jr., a wealthy Republican business executive, was running to represent a competitive House district in northeastern Pennsylvania, he published a letter to the editor in a local newspaper demanding an end to stock trading by members of Congress. “The trust our political leaders and institutions have from Americans is at a historic low and it’s easy to understand why,” Mr. Bresnahan wrote in the Wilkes-Barre Citizens’ Voice. “Too often we hear about how politicians are making millions of dollars during their time in office, and it is sickening. If we want to restore trust in government and our political leaders, then Congress needs to lead with these policies.” If elected, Mr. Bresnahan told voters, he would co-sponsor legislation to ban stock trading by members of Congress, a practice he said “needs to come to an end immediately.” More than two months after being sworn in, Mr. Bresnahan, who defeated a Democratic incumbent last November in one of the most expensive House races in the country, has not introduced or co-sponsored such a bill. Over that time, he has emerged as one of the most active stock traders in the freshman class, according to Capitol Trades, a site that monitors the stock market activity of lawmakers. Since he took office in January, Mr. Bresnahan has reported 264 stock trades, according to the site. He has purchased up to $1.7 million in stock since taking office, according to his periodic transaction report, and has sold up to $3.03 million. Lawmakers in both parties have long championed the issue of banning individual stock trading for members of Congress as a way to appeal to growing populist sentiment among constituents. They note that lawmakers have access to classified intelligence reports, meet with chief executives and play a key role in setting economic policies, creating at least the appearance of conflicts.

"The Rev. Arul Carasala was found outside his parish rectory with gunshot wounds on Thursday, officials said. An Oklahoma man was arrested, though a motive remained unknown.",2025-04-05,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The Rev. Arul Carasala was found outside his parish rectory with gunshot wounds on Thursday, officials said. An Oklahoma man was arrested, though a motive remained unknown. By Claire Fahy A man fatally shot a Catholic priest outside his parish rectory in Kansas on Thursday in an attack with no known motive, the authorities said. The priest, Arul Carasala, 57, was found with gunshot wounds at around 3 p.m. by state troopers outside the Saints Peter and Paul Catholic Church rectory in Seneca, Kan., according to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. The priest was brought to a hospital where he died from his injuries. Shortly after, the authorities arrested Gary L. Hermesch, 66. On Friday, prosecutors charged Mr. Hermesch with first-degree murder, saying that the shooting was intentional and premeditated, according to court documents. A motive was not immediately given for the shooting. Jason Belveal, a lawyer for Mr. Hermesch, declined to comment on Saturday. “This senseless act of violence has left us grieving the loss of a beloved priest, leader, and friend,” Archbishop Joseph F. Naumann of Kansas City said on Facebook. He added, “Let us also pray for the perpetrator, that God may touch and transform his heart.” Seneca is a town of about 2,000 people in northern Kansas, near the border with Nebraska. The authorities said Mr. Hermesch is from Tulsa, Okla., which is about 300 miles south of Seneca. The Kansas City Star reported that Mr. Hermesch turned himself in at the Nemaha County Sheriff’s Office, where his brother works as a dispatcher. Mr. Hermesch grew up in Seneca, The Star said, before moving to Tulsa. He had grown angry with the Catholic Church in recent years, and wrote a number of letters to the editor of local newspapers criticizing the “the fake Catholic Church” for its modern teachings. Raj “Arul” Balaswamy Carasala was born in Cuddapah, India, a city in the country’s southeast. According to an online biography, Father Carasala became the pastor of Saints Peter and Paul parish on July 15, 2011. He was ordained in the Diocese of Cuddapah and moved in 2004 to Kansas, where he served in four different parishes before settling in Seneca. Father Carasala became an American citizen on May 20, 2011, according to the biography. He maintained his ties to India, and believed that “the church is home wherever he is.” Archbishop Naumann said Mass on Thursday evening in Father Carasala’s honor, according to social media posts. “While we continue to mourn the loss of Father Arul, I pray that we will not lose hope. God is with us in our adversity,” Archbishop Naumann said. “He can bring good out of evil.” Sheelagh McNeill contributed research.

Democratic lawmakers have denounced the cuts.",2025-04-05,"The New York Times","U.S.A.I.D. Advertisement Supported by The move comes despite Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying the U.S. would still do some humanitarian work while shrinking foreign aid. Democratic lawmakers have denounced the cuts. By Edward Wong and Hannah Beech Edward Wong reported from Washington and Hannah Beech from New York. Both have reported on international news from around the globe for decades. Trump administration officials have fired workers for the main American aid agency who were sent to Myanmar to assess how the United States could help with earthquake relief efforts, three people with knowledge of the actions said. The firings, done Friday while the workers were in the rubble-strewn city of Mandalay, raise doubts about Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s stated commitment to continuing some humanitarian and crisis aid even as the aid organization, the U.S. Agency for International Development, is dismantled by the Trump administration. More than 3,300 people were killed and more than 4,800 injured in Myanmar, according to Burmese government estimates. A tropical storm was lashing much of the country on Saturday, with heavy rain and winds leading to flooding. The Trump administration has been criticized by Democratic lawmakers and others for what they called its paltry response. The three experienced aid workers got termination emails addressed specifically to them just days after arriving in Myanmar, said the three people with knowledge of the situation, who are current and former U.S.A.I.D. officials. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution. One of the aid workers had flown in from Washington, and the other two from Bangkok and Manila, where the aid agency has regional operations. Other aid agency employees said they were furious over the way the workers in Myanmar had been fired. Separately, U.S. diplomats said on Friday they were worried that changes in the top ranks of the State Department that took place that day could presage wider purges and layoffs to come there. Besides enacting American foreign policy, the department is taking over all foreign aid now that U.S.A.I.D. is being dismantled. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The party was on at a Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament at the president’s Doral resort in Florida and a fund-raiser at Mar-a-Lago, even as markets tumbled.",2025-04-05,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The party was on at a Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament at the president’s Doral resort in Florida and a fund-raiser at Mar-a-Lago, even as markets tumbled. By Eric LiptonTheodore Schleifer and Zolan Kanno-Youngs Eric Lipton reported from Trump National Doral in Miami, Theodore Schleifer from Washington, and Zolan Kanno-Youngs from Palm Beach, Fla. The financial market meltdown was underway when President Trump boarded Air Force One on his way to Florida on Thursday for a doubleheader of sorts: a Saudi-backed golf tournament at his family’s Miami resort and a weekend of fund-raisers attracting hundreds of donors to his Palm Beach club. It was a fresh reminder that in his second term, Mr. Trump has continued to find ways to drive business to his family-owned real-estate ventures, a practice he has sustained even when his work in Washington has caused worldwide financial turmoil. The Trump family monetization weekend started Thursday night, as crowds began to form at both the Trump National Doral resort near Miami International Airport, and separately at his Mar-a-Lago resort 70 miles up the coast. Mr. Trump landed on the edge of one of the golf courses in a military helicopter — just in time for a dinner at Doral. The next day, LIV Golf, the breakaway professional league backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, was scheduled to hold a tournament at the course for the fourth time. On Thursday at Mar-a-Lago, hundreds of guests gathered for the American Patriots Gala, a conservative fund-raiser that featured Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Javier Milei of Argentina, who told his supporters back home that he was hoping to catch up with Mr. Trump while there, seemingly unaware that Mr. Trump was double-booked at two of his family properties that night. And that was just the weekend’s lead-up. Mr. Trump ordered a new set of global tariffs on Wednesday from the White House using his trademark Sharpie pen, a version of which is on sale at Mar-a-Lago for $3.

By Simon J. Levien A judge awarded a total of $6.6 million to four former high-level aides to Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, who claimed that they were unduly fired after reporting him to federal investigators and accusing him of corruption in 2020. The plaintiffs — Blake Brickman, Mark Penley, David Maxwell and Ryan Vassar — proved that the attorney general’s office violated the state’s whistle-blower act, Judge Catherine Mauzy of a district court in Travis County ruled on Friday. Each plaintiff was awarded between $1 million and more than $2 million for lost wages, emotional pain, legal fees and other costs associated with the trial. “The Court finds that Plaintiffs have proved liability, damages, and reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees by a preponderance of the evidence,” Judge Mauzy wrote in her ruling. Judge Mauzy also noted that Mr. Paxton never disputed any issue or fact in the case, opting not to contest his office’s liability. Mr. Paxton did not testify. Tom Nesbitt, a lawyer for Mr. Brickman, celebrated the decision. “Yesterday’s judgment is the natural and intended consequence of Ken Paxton’s choice to surrender rather than fight the whistle-blowers’ claims in court,” he said in a statement on Saturday.

"The billionaire adviser to the Trump administration appeared to part ways with the president in a videoconference appearance with Italy’s far-right League party.",2025-04-05,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The billionaire adviser to the Trump administration appeared to part ways with the president in a videoconference appearance with Italy’s far-right League party. By Emma Bubola Reporting from Rome Only three days after President Trump announced sweeping tariffs, including a 20 percent tariff on goods from the European Union, Elon Musk said on Saturday that he hoped that Europe and the United States would move “to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone.” Mr. Musk made the remarks during a videoconference appearance with Italy’s far-right League party in Florence. They came after the tech billionaire turned presidential confidant had stayed largely silent about Mr. Trump’s tariffs. However, earlier Saturday, Mr. Musk had taken a very public swipe at Peter Navarro, one of Mr. Trump’s most ardently protectionist advisers when it comes to trade policy. In response to an X post praising Mr. Navarro, Mr. Musk first mocked Mr. Navarro’s Ivy League degree as useless. He then said Mr. Navarro had not “built” anything, using an expletive to make his point. In Mr. Musk’s vernacular, being a “builder” or a “doer” is a high achievement. During his League party appearance in Florence, Mr. Musk said he hoped that the United States and Europe could “establish a very close partnership,” a statement that contrasted with the contempt members of Mr. Trump’s administration have shown for Europe, and statements by Mr. Trump himself, who claimed the European Union was created to “screw” America. He added that he wished there was “more freedom of people to move between Europe and North America.” During Mr. Trump’s first term, Mr. Musk had said there should be “no tariffs at all either way” between the United States and Britain. Mr. Musk’s appearance at the League’s meeting, in which he warned of the dangers of censorship and mass immigration, came as he continued to use his influence to bolster far-right forces across Europe. On Friday, Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump had expressed support for Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader, who was convicted this past week on embezzlement charges and disqualified from running for public office. Earlier this year, Mr. Musk publicized the German far-right Alternative for Germany party and weighed into Italy’s immigration debate, prompting the country’s president to rebuke him. On Saturday, he appeared at the party conference with Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League party. During his brief speech, Mr. Musk also promoted the activities of his cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, supported Mr. Trump’s position on the war in Ukraine and attacked what he called the overregulation of the European Union.

By Glenn Thrush Reporting from Washington A senior Justice Department immigration lawyer was put on indefinite leave Saturday after questioning the Trump administration’s decision to deport a Maryland man to El Salvador — one day after representing the government in court. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche suspended Erez Reuveni, the acting deputy director of the department’s immigration litigation division, for failing to “follow a directive from your superiors,” according to a letter sent to Mr. Reuveni and obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Reuveni — who was praised as a “top-notched” prosecutor by his superiors in an email announcing his promotion two weeks ago — is the latest career official to be suspended, demoted, transferred or fired for refusing to comply with a directive from President Trump’s appointees to take actions they deem improper or unethical. “At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States,” Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote in a statement sent to The Times on Saturday. “Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.” Under questioning by a federal judge on Friday, Mr. Reuveni conceded that the deportation last month of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who had a court order allowing him to stay in the United States, should never have taken place. Mr. Reuveni also said he had been frustrated when the case landed on his desk. Mr. Reuveni, a respected 15-year veteran of the immigration division, asked the judge for 24 hours to persuade his “client,” the Trump administration, to begin the process of retrieving and repatriating Mr. Abrego Garcia.

"Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was making the move because the transitional government of South Sudan had refused to accept its citizens in a timely manner.",2025-04-05,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was making the move because the transitional government of South Sudan had refused to accept its citizens in a timely manner. By Edward Wong and Hamed Aleaziz Reporting from Washington Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday that he was revoking the visas of all South Sudan passport holders because the country’s transitional government had refused to accept in a “timely manner” citizens who were being deported by the Trump administration. Mr. Rubio also said in a social media post that he would “restrict any further issuance to prevent entry” of South Sudanese, blaming the “failure of South Sudan’s transitional government” to accept the repatriations. In a statement issued through the State Department, Mr. Rubio said, “we will be prepared to review these actions when South Sudan is in full cooperation.” Mr. Rubio’s action is similar to one that President Trump announced in late January, when he threatened Colombian officials with revocation of their visas and tariffs on the country’s exports because they were refusing to accept U.S. military flights with Colombian deportees. In that case, Colombia reversed its decision quickly. The decision by Mr. Rubio to approve such a sweeping action on the visas of South Sudanese travelers and immigrants is a further sign of the Trump administration’s intense focus on trying to deport as many foreign citizens from the United States as quickly as possible, an action that Mr. Trump promised he would take while on the campaign trail. Some of the potential deportees have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration, and several judges have issued temporary restraining orders as a result. South Sudan’s ambassador to Britain, Nickson Deng, said Sunday that his country’s government had yet to receive an official communication from the U.S. government on the issue and would not comment further.

"The verdict will likely influence similar lawsuits against other oil companies over coastal damage in the state.",2025-04-06,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The verdict will likely influence similar lawsuits against other oil companies over coastal damage in the state. By Adeel Hassan A jury in Louisiana has ruled that Chevron must pay a parish government about $745 million to help restore wetlands that the jury said the energy company had harmed for decades. The verdict, which was reached on Friday, is likely to influence similar lawsuits filed by other parishes, or counties, in the state against other energy giants and their possible settlement negotiations. The lawsuit, filed by Plaquemines Parish, is one of at least 40 that coastal parishes have filed against fossil fuel companies since 2013. The lawsuit contended that Texaco — which Chevron bought in 2000 — violated state law for decades by failing to apply for coastal permits, and by not removing oil and gas equipment when it stopped using an oil field in Breton Sound, which is southeast of New Orleans. A state regulation in 1980 required companies operating in wetlands to restore “as near as practicable to their original condition” any canals that they dredged, wells that they drilled or wastewater that they dumped into marshes.

By Billy Witz Reporting from Pittsburgh The digital billboards began popping up recently on busy thoroughfares in Pittsburgh and more than a dozen other American cities and towns. The simple white letters on a stark black background carried a pointed message. Tariffs are a tax on groceries. Tariffs are a tax at the gas pump. Tariffs are a tax on hardworking Americans. The billboards aren’t paid for by an industry trade group or a political action committee, but rather by the government of Canada, a point that is noted in the not-so-fine print. The advertising campaign is another sign of how the neighbors to the north are responding to President Trump’s provocations, be it his tariff threats or his musings about annexing their country as the 51st state. The Canadians are coming in elbows up and sticks high, to borrow from the true common language between Canadians and Pittsburghers — hockey. “It’s interesting to see Canada, which to the average American has been a passive partner, take this tough guy stance,” said Nick Canada, a doctoral student in rhetoric at the University of Pittsburgh who, alas, grew up in northern Florida. “The billboards are almost militaristic in style, like you’d see on a bumper sticker. They’re piercing this veil of ignorance of the world stage and condensing this huge problem into a very tangible, understandable phrase.” Canada was spared when President Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs on 70 countries on Wednesday, though Washington’s protectionist push is still hitting pockets of the Canadian economy.

By Jesus Jiménez Reporting from Los Angeles The morning after the Eaton fire broke out in Southern California, Sergio Lopez and his father returned to Altadena in a last-ditch effort to save their property. As powerful winds sent embers flying across their neighborhood, the father and son tried to douse the property with a garden hose. But as the fire crept closer, they had no choice but to flee. The house was destroyed. Not long after, more bad news came. Mr. Lopez, a teacher at John Muir High School in Pasadena, Calif., was at an academic conference in Sacramento when he got a phone call from the principal. He was being laid off. Seven weeks after losing his home, he was told he was losing his job. Mr. Lopez is one of 151 workers with the Pasadena Unified School District who received layoff notices this year. And he’s one of a dozen teachers who both lost their homes during the Eaton fire and are preparing to lose their jobs when the school year ends. “After losing my home, my classroom was basically all I owned,” Mr. Lopez said. “Everything that I had owned after the fire was left inside my classroom.” Layoff notices across California school districts are typical early in the calendar year. But in a school district where thousands of students and employees were forced to evacuate during the wildfire, the layoff notices in Pasadena have been a heavy blow, a crisis upon crisis for many families.

"Colleges and teaching hospitals are the cornerstones of the city’s economy — and identity. But federal funding cuts to higher education could change that.",2025-04-06,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Colleges and teaching hospitals are the cornerstones of the city’s economy — and identity. But federal funding cuts to higher education could change that. By Jenna Russell Reporting from Boston For generations, students and researchers from around the world have flocked to Boston, drawn not just to a college or university but to a region where high-minded intellectual life was part of its brand. The Boston area has thrived from their presence, its many schools and top-ranked research hospitals keeping its economy strong and its living standard largely unmatched in the United States. “It’s the densest concentration of academic talent in the world,” said Lawrence S. Bacow, who served as president of Harvard University from 2018 to 2023 and as president of Tufts University from 2001 to 2011. “Universities and teaching hospitals are to Boston what cars are to Detroit, what energy is to Houston or finance is to New York.” Now, though, the city is seized with anxiety. The Trump administration’s assault on funding for higher education poses a bigger threat to Boston and the surrounding region than perhaps anywhere else in the country. Harvard is facing a government review of $9 billion in federal grants and contracts, several universities are freezing hiring and rescinding admissions offers, research labs are closing, and international students are being targeted for deportation. And Boston is confronting a once-implausible question: Will its core identity survive? “Boston is the target in this fight,” Mayor Michelle Wu said in her State of the City speech last month. “We were built on the values this federal administration seeks to tear down.”  There has rarely been cause to question that key component of the city’s identity, since John Harvard donated some 800 pounds of sterling, and his library of 400 books, to the fledgling college that would bear his name, established by the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636. The first public school in the country, Boston Latin, was founded in Boston a year earlier; the state’s constitution required every town to establish grammar schools.

"Senate Republicans are hoping to ice Democrats out from deciding the fate of President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, a move that Democrats could eventually use against them.",2025-04-06,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Senate Republicans are hoping to ice Democrats out from deciding the fate of President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, a move that Democrats could eventually use against them. By Andrew Duehren Reporting from Washington When Republicans cut taxes in the past, they did so only temporarily, bowing to Washington’s arcane budget rules that limited how much they could add to the federal deficit. They gambled — mostly successfully — that the tax cuts would not actually end because Democrats would eventually vote to continue them. With this year’s tax cut, though, many Republicans no longer want to take that risk. In the Senate, Republicans approved a budget outline on Saturday that opens the door to locking in the Trump tax cuts indefinitely without Democratic support. Actually doing so would require Republicans to upend Senate procedures that have long governed what lawmakers can accomplish along party lines. That would mark a dramatic change in the hidebound institution, and invite Democrats to take major new steps of their own when they next control the chamber. Senate Republicans believe that the Trump tax cuts are worth it. The party first passed the cuts in 2017, lowering individual income rates for most people, expanding the standard deduction and slashing corporate taxes. Because they used standard Washington accounting methods at the time, many of the tax cuts are set to expire at the end of this year. Lawmakers are now facing a fiscal cliff that would increase taxes on many Americans if another bill isn’t passed. Republicans acknowledge their good fortune in controlling Congress and the White House as the tax cuts come to an end. They can keep them going without having to negotiate with Democrats, who have sought to roll back some of the cuts. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The 22nd Amendment is clear: President Trump has to give up his office after his second term. But his refusal to accept that underscores how far he is willing to consider going to consolidate power.",2025-04-06,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by News Analysis The 22nd Amendment is clear: President Trump has to give up his office after his second term. But his refusal to accept that underscores how far he is willing to consider going to consolidate power. By Peter Baker Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent, is covering his sixth presidency and reported from Washington. After President Trump said last year that he wanted to be a dictator for a day, he insisted that he was only joking. Now he is saying that he may try to hold onto power even after the Constitution stipulates that he must give it up, and this time he insists he is not joking. Maybe he is and maybe he isn’t. Mr. Trump loves stirring the pot and getting a rise out of critics. Talk of an unconstitutional third term distracts from other news and delays the day he is seen as a lame duck. Certainly some in his own camp consider it a joke as Republican leaders laugh it off and White House aides mock reporters for taking it too seriously. But the fact that Mr. Trump has inserted the idea into the national conversation illustrates the uncertainty about the future of America’s constitutional system, nearly 250 years after the country gained independence. More than at any time in generations, a president’s commitment to limits on power and the rule of law is under question and his critics fear that the country is on a dark path. After all, Mr. Trump already tried once to hold onto power in defiance of the Constitution when he sought to overturn the 2020 election despite losing. He later called for “termination” of the Constitution to return himself to the White House without a new election. And in the 11 weeks since he resumed office, he has pressed the boundaries of executive power more than any of his modern predecessors. “This is in my mind a culmination of what he has already started, which is a methodical effort to destabilize and undermine our democracy so that he can assume much greater power,” Representative Daniel Goldman, Democrat of New York and lead counsel during Mr. Trump’s first impeachment, said in an interview. “A lot of people are not talking about it because it’s not the most pressing issue of that particular day,” he said on Friday as stock markets were plunging in reaction to Mr. Trump’s newly declared trade war. But an attack on democracy, he added, “is actually in motion and people need to recognize that it is not hypothetical or speculative anymore.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Judge Paula Xinis, who has ordered that the Trump administration return the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, by Monday, also rejected a request to pause that order.",2025-04-06,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Judge Paula Xinis, who has ordered that the Trump administration return the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, by Monday, also rejected a request to pause that order. By Alan Feuer The Trump administration committed a “grievous error” that “shocks the conscience” by inadvertently deporting a Salvadoran migrant to a notorious prison last month and then declaring there was little it could do to bring him back, a federal judge in Maryland said on Sunday. The strongly worded order by the judge, Paula Xinis, served two purposes: It offered a more detailed explanation of a brief ruling she issued on Friday, demanding that the White House bring the migrant, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, back to the United States by the end of Monday. And it rejected a request by the Justice Department to pause the order as a federal appeals court considered its validity. Over 22 pages, Judge Xinis took Trump officials to task for deporting Mr. Abrego Garcia to El Salvador on March 15 in violation of a previous court order that allowed him to stay in the United States. Administration officials then argued that neither they nor she as the judge overseeing the case had any power to retrieve him from the prison. “As defendants acknowledge, they had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador — let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere,” Judge Xinis wrote. “Having confessed grievous error, the defendants now argue that this court lacks the power to hear this case, and they lack the power to order Abrego Garcia’s return.” Moreover, Judge Xinis questioned the administration’s underlying claims that Mr. Abrego Garcia, 29, was a member of a violent transnational street gang, MS-13, which officials recently designated as a terrorist organization. The judge described those claims as being based on “a singular unsubstantiated allegation.” “The ‘evidence’ against Abrego Garcia consisted of nothing more than his Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie,” she wrote, “and a vague, uncorroborated allegation from a confidential informant claiming he belonged to MS-13’s ‘Western’ clique in New York — a place he has never lived.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The president said he would not quickly reverse last week’s steep tariffs, which have sparked pushback and roiled markets.",2025-04-06,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The president said he would not quickly reverse last week’s steep tariffs, which have sparked pushback and roiled markets. By Tony Romm and Ana Swanson Reporting from Washington President Trump said on Sunday that he would not reverse tariffs on other nations unless the trade deficits that the United States runs with China, the European Union and other nations disappeared. His comments indicated that the steep import taxes that have panicked global businesses and investors would be in place for the long run. “Hundreds of billions of dollars a year we lose with China,” Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “And unless we solve that problem, I’m not going to make a deal.” He added that he was “willing to deal with China, but they have to solve their surplus.” Mr. Trump’s comments came just hours after his top aides raced to defend the president’s expansive global tariffs, which sent global markets into a tailspin last week. As Mr. Trump departed his Mar-a-Lago estate for another day of golfing at his club in Jupiter, Fla., his leading economic advisers dismissed the turmoil the tariffs have unleashed in financial markets around the world, insisting that the president’s trade war would ultimately improve the nation’s economic fortunes. But they also sent mixed signals over the extent to which Mr. Trump sees tariffs as a negotiating tool, even as many of his aides said on Sunday that they had heard from more than 50 nations looking to find a way out of the tariffs. “The tariffs are coming.

"In the first weekend since President Trump unveiled broad tariffs, many shoppers sought to get ahead of expected price increases, while others showed patience.",2025-04-06,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by In the first weekend since President Trump unveiled broad tariffs, many shoppers sought to get ahead of expected price increases, while others showed patience. By Orlando Mayorquín Charlene and Phil Willingham had been thinking for a while about replacing the 20-year-old appliances in their kitchen, but with the sudden prospect of rising costs, they decided that this was the moment. The Willinghams, both retired, turned up at a store in the suburbs of Chicago on Friday with a long shopping list: stove, refrigerator, microwave oven and dishwasher. “We were going to take our time to get new appliances, but now because of these tariffs, I want to get them before any price increases take place,” Ms. Willingham, 64, said while shopping at the Abt Electronics store in Glenview, Ill. Of the Trump administration’s sweeping announcement of tariffs across the globe last week, she said, “It sort of set the fire.” In grocery stores, car dealerships, malls and big discount chains around the country, interviews with more than two dozen Americans this weekend showed that many were racing to figure out how to get ahead of the new tariffs plan, quickly making calculated purchases, big and small. “The panic is enough to make me want to buy,” Shali Santos, 28, said, after stocking up on essentials in bulk — water, soap, mouthwash — at a Costco Wholesale store in Marina del Rey, a waterfront community in Los Angeles County, and noticing that many people around her seemed to be stocking up more than usual on similar staples. Others said their shopping habits were unchanged by the tariffs announcement, largely because they had patience and trust in the president’s long game, and figured that any short-term pain, including potential cost increases, would work itself out. “I’m confident it will recover,” Gregg Harris, 61, said as he shopped for food at a Walmart in Nashville.

Starting around 2013, something changed.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by For years, the country’s lowest-scoring students were steadily improving on national tests. Starting around 2013, something changed. By Sarah Mervosh There was once a time when America’s lowest-performing students were improving just as much as the country’s top students. Despite their low scores, these students at the bottom made slow but steady gains on national tests for much of the 2000s. It was one sign that the U.S. education system was working, perhaps not spectacularly, but at least enough to help struggling students keep pace with the gains of the most privileged and successful. Today, the country’s lowest-scoring students are in free fall. Top scorers shown are at the 90th percentile; lowest scorers are at the 10th. Scores are from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which tests a national sample of students to track educational achievement. Source: NAEP By Francesca Paris The reason is not just the pandemic. For at least a decade, starting around 2013, students in the bottom quartile have been losing ground on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a key exam that tests a national sample of fourth and eighth grade students in math and reading. The bottom quartile is made up of students from various backgrounds, but it includes a higher proportion of students with disabilities, students learning English and children from poor families.

Credit...Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times Supported by By Michael S. Schmidt Michael S. Schmidt, an investigative reporter for The Times, covered Mr. Trump’s attempts to weaponize the Justice Department and F.B.I. in his first term and has been tracking his retribution campaign since he retook office. When President Trump returned to office, his rivals and law enforcement officials feared he would follow through on his pledges to use the Justice Department and F.B.I. to investigate and even imprison his perceived enemies. But since winning re-election, Mr. Trump’s retribution campaign has turned out to be far more expansive, efficient and creative than anticipated. It has also been less reliant on the justice system. Not only has he found new ways to use his power to target those he has demonized, but his actions — or just the prospect of them — have led some of those he has gone after to change their behavior and fall into line. Mr. Trump has employed tactics including lawsuits, executive orders, regulations, dismissals from government jobs, withdrawal of security details and public intimidation to take on a wide range of individuals and institutions he views as having unfairly pursued him or sought to block his agenda. In the process, he has blurred the personal and the political, making it difficult in some instances, like his targeting of academic and cultural institutions, to distinguish between his grievances and policy goals.

Native American leaders have doubts. “It’s shameful,” one said.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says he is committed to improving the Indian Health Service. Native American leaders have doubts. “It’s shameful,” one said. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg Reporting from Washington Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made a show on Facebook of his meeting with American Indian and Alaska Native leaders last month, declaring himself “very inspired” and committed to improving the Indian Health Service, which he says has “always been treated as the redheaded stepchild” by his agency. Now Native leaders have some questions for him. Why, they would like to know, did he lay off employees in programs aimed at supporting Native people, like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Healthy Tribes initiative? Why has he shuttered five regional offices of the Department of Health and Human Services that, by the estimate of one advocate for tribes, cover 80 percent of the nation’s Indian population? Why were five senior advisers for tribal issues within the department’s Administration for Children and Families, all of them Indian or Native people, let go? Why are all of these changes being made without consulting tribal leaders, despite centuries-old treaty obligations, as well as presidential executive orders, requiring it? But the final indignity, Native leaders say, came last week, when Mr. Kennedy reassigned high-ranking health officials — including a bioethicist married to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a tobacco regulator, a human resources manager and others — to Indian Health Service locations in the American West, when what the chronically understaffed service really needs are doctors and nurses who are familiar with the unique needs of Native people. “They are breaching their trust obligation to Indian tribes by all of the scams that they’re doing,” said Deb Haaland, the former interior secretary and congresswoman, who is a member of the Laguna Pueblo tribe and a Democratic candidate for governor of New Mexico. “It’s terrible, it’s shameful and it isn’t right.” This week, Mr. Kennedy will visit Native health providers and meet with tribal leaders in Arizona and New Mexico to spotlight his commitment to Indian health. The secretary, who has also been invited to appear before the Senate health committee to testify about the job cuts and the vast reorganization of his department, has spoken often of his and his family’s longstanding commitment to Native Americans. The Coalition of Large Tribes, an advocacy group, gave his nomination its highest endorsement. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"After years struggling to compete with cheaper, farm-raised imported shrimp, shrimpers from Florida to Louisiana are optimistic that the new tariffs will help them.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by After years struggling to compete with cheaper, farm-raised imported shrimp, shrimpers from Florida to Louisiana are optimistic that the new tariffs will help them. By Emily Cochrane Emily Cochrane interviewed shrimpers, processors and industry officials in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. She also ate some Florida pink shrimp. In December, Frank Parker upgraded to a bigger shrimp boat. For the Mississippi shrimper, it was a good trade with an older fisherman who was looking to scale back. But the driving force behind acquiring a boat that would allow Mr. Parker to stay in deeper waters for two weeks at a time was President Trump’s return to the White House, and his promise to tax nearly all imports. When Mr. Trump followed through on that promise and levied tariffs across the world this week, Mr. Parker, 52, said it felt “like the sun coming out of the tunnel.” It had been years since he had felt even a sliver of optimism about the shrimping industry, which his family has been in since his ancestors moved to Biloxi, Miss., in 1842. Gulf Coast shrimpers have been pummeled in recent years by natural and man-made disasters, as well as rising fuel costs. But Mr. Trump’s tariffs, Mr. Parker and several other shrimpers said last week, could go a long way toward quashing perhaps their biggest financial threat: the cheap, farm-raised imported shrimp flooding the American market. Now, the biggest exporters of shrimp, like Vietnam, Indonesia and India, face some of the largest tariffs. In recent years, the average price of headless shrimp has dropped to as low as $1.50 per pound for some sizes of shrimp along the Gulf Coast — while the costs of diesel fuel and running a business have climbed. “I’ve left shrimp out there because I didn’t want to give them away for $1 a pound,” Mr. Parker said of recent shrimping trips. He added, “I don’t see it getting any worse. We’re at the bottom of the barrel now.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"Conservative judges have come to opposite conclusions on what the Second Amendment has to say about limiting the gun rights of those under 21.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Sidebar Conservative judges have come to opposite conclusions on what the Second Amendment has to say about limiting the gun rights of those under 21. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington The next big Second Amendment case may concern teenagers. Appeals courts are split on whether the government may restrict 18- to 20-year-olds from buying or carrying guns, and the Supreme Court will consider next week whether to hear one of those cases. You might expect the differing views on the lower courts to divide along predictable lines, with judges appointed by Republicans on one side and those appointed by Democrats on the other. But this is an issue that has created a rift among conservative judges committed to unearthing the original meaning of the Constitution. Last month, for instance, Judge William H. Pryor Jr. wrote the majority opinion for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, in an 8-to-4 decision upholding a Florida law that prohibits the sale of firearms to people under 21. No one doubts that Judge Pryor is a conservative. He was on President Trump’s short list in 2017 to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The conventional wisdom was that Judge Pryor would face a tough confirmation battle — because he was too far to the right. “Pryor has done more for the cause than anyone else in the country,” a White House official said at the time. “But the politics are really tough.” Judge Pryor’s supporters said he would not waver or evolve. “He has a real titanium spine in terms of doing the right thing,” an official of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative group, said of the judge in 2017.

"The World Series winners’ trip comes after the Trump administration was criticized for removing an article on a Pentagon website honoring Jackie Robinson, one of the franchise’s most celebrated players.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The World Series winners’ trip comes after the Trump administration was criticized for removing an article on a Pentagon website honoring Jackie Robinson, one of the franchise’s most celebrated players. By Tim Balk The Los Angeles Dodgers are set to visit the White House on Monday, continuing a decades-old tradition for the reigning World Series champions that has been fraught with political tension while President Trump has occupied the Oval Office. In Mr. Trump’s first term, the customary visit was boycotted by some Black and Latino players. And before the Dodgers won the World Series in 2020, their manager, Dave Roberts, had suggested he would skip any visits to the Trump White House. But Joseph R. Biden Jr. defeated Mr. Trump that fall and hosted the team the following year. The franchise won the championship again in 2024, and this year, it does not appear that any Dodgers are planning to skip the visit. Their star shortstop, Mookie Betts, who refused to go to the White House in 2019 after winning a title with the Boston Red Sox, said he would attend this time. The Dodgers’ visit comes after the Trump administration was heavily criticized for removing an article on a Pentagon website celebrating Jackie Robinson, who broke baseball’s color barrier and is one of the franchise’s most celebrated players. The Defense Department, which has worked to purge any references to diversity, equity and inclusion on its sites, restored the page after backlash. Bob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Mo., said that he was “flabbergasted” by the removal and that it would be “atrocious” to reduce Robinson’s career to a “D.E.I. story.” Robinson endured intense verbal abuse when he integrated Major League Baseball during the 1947 season. (At the time, the Dodgers played in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn; they moved to Los Angeles in 1958.) Few if any players are held in higher regard by the sport: Robinson’s number, 42, was retired leaguewide in 1997. The sport celebrates Jackie Robinson Day each year on April 15, when every player wears a No. 42 uniform. Mr. Betts said last week that he regretted boycotting the White House visit with the Red Sox, but that being “Black in America in a situation like this, it’s a tough spot to be in,” according to The Athletic. Mr. Roberts, one of two Black managers in the M.L.B., said that the Dodgers had collectively decided to go to the White House. The trip is “not a political thing,” Mr. Roberts said, and is simply intended to celebrate the team’s World Series title. “We have a lot of different people that are part of this organization,” Mr. Roberts told reporters last week. “Different backgrounds. Different cultures, race, gender. And so everyone has a different story.” “We are all going as an organization,” he said, adding: “We’re all aligned.” Advertisement","world series winners trip comes trump administration criticized removing article pentagon website honoring jackie robinson one franchise celebrated players tim balk los angeles dodgers set visit white house monday continuing decades old tradition reigning world series champions fraught political tension president trump occupied oval office mr trump first term customary visit boycotted black latino players dodgers won world series manager dave roberts suggested skip visits trump white house joseph r biden jr defeated mr trump fall hosted team following year franchise won championship year appear dodgers planning skip visit star shortstop mookie betts refused go white house winning title boston red sox said attend time dodgers visit comes trump administration heavily criticized removing article pentagon website celebrating jackie robinson broke baseball color barrier one franchise celebrated players defense department worked purge references diversity equity inclusion sites restored page backlash bob kendrick president negro leagues baseball museum kansas city mo said flabbergasted removal atrocious reduce robinson career dei story robinson endured intense verbal abuse integrated major league baseball season time dodgers played flatbush section brooklyn moved los angeles players held higher regard sport robinson number retired leaguewide sport celebrates jackie robinson day year april every player wears uniform mr betts said last week regretted boycotting white house visit red sox black america situation like tough spot according athletic mr roberts one two black managers mlb said dodgers collectively decided go white house trip political thing mr roberts said simply intended celebrate team world series title lot different people part organization mr roberts told reporters last week different backgrounds different cultures race gender everyone different story going organization said adding re aligned"

Friends and colleagues describe Judge James E. Boasberg as a moderate, known for his calm temperament and thoughtful jurisprudence.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times Supported by By Mattathias Schwartz and Alan Feuer Before they were federal judges, James Emanuel Boasberg and Brett M. Kavanaugh were classmates at Yale Law School and housemates in a red brick off-campus townhouse, where they forged a bond that carries forward to this day. Their friendship, according to interviews with six law school classmates, draws on a foundation of commonalities: Both men are the sons of attorneys and attended elite private high schools in Washington — Georgetown Preparatory for Justice Kavanaugh, St. Albans for Judge Boasberg. Both went to Yale as undergraduates. Both were first appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush. As judges, they overlapped for more than seven years at the E. Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse in Washington, D.C. The two jurists, neither of whom commented for this story, “have a lot in common,” said Amy Jeffress, a former law school classmate, who said Judge Boasberg and Justice Kavanaugh have been close since she knew them in school. Friends and colleagues describe Judge Boasberg, who goes by Jeb, as a moderate, known for his calm temperament and thoughtful jurisprudence. He is also a particularly well-respected jurist with deep ties to members of the conservative legal establishment, such as Justice Kavanaugh. In 2018, President Trump elevated Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Last month, the president called for Judge Boasberg to be removed from the bench after he issued an order temporarily stopping the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, to deport men accused of being Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. Mr. Trump called Judge Boasberg, 62, “a Radical Left Lunatic, a troublemaker and agitator.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Advertisement Supported by The complaint against the businessman, Bashar Masri, does not say that he knew about the Oct. 7 attack in advance but does assert that he was aware of the Hamas military infrastructure at his properties. By Adam Goldman Reporting from Washington Families of victims of the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, sued a prominent Palestinian American businessman on Monday, accusing him of supporting Hamas by developing properties that were crucial to the terrorist group’s operations. According to the lawsuit, Bashar Masri, a wealthy developer, operated hotels and an industrial site in Gaza to “construct and conceal” a labyrinthine network of tunnels that allowed Hamas to “store and launch its rockets at Israel.” “The properties defendants developed with Hamas were not only part of the infrastructure Hamas used in connection with the Oct. 7 attack itself,” the lawsuit added. “Their development deliberately advanced Hamas’s false narrative that it was interested primarily in the economic development of Gaza and a grudging coexistence with Israel.” The lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in Washington, where Mr. Masri has a home. It does not say that Mr. Masri and the companies he controls knew about the attack in advance but does assert that they were aware of the Hamas military infrastructure at their properties. Mr. Masri, a respected entrepreneur, denied the allegations. Mr. Masri “was shocked to learn through the media that a baseless complaint was filed today referring to false allegations against him and certain businesses he is associated with,” a statement from his office said. “Neither he nor those entities have ever engaged in unlawful activity or provided support for violence and militancy.” The complaint comes at a politically sensitive time for Mr. Masri, who has been linked to the hostage envoy for the Trump administration who has been involved in efforts to free the remaining captives being held by Hamas in Gaza.

"Thousands of plaintiffs, once children in Los Angeles County’s juvenile detention and foster care systems, are part of a record-breaking payout.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times"," Thousands of plaintiffs, once children in Los Angeles County’s juvenile detention and foster care systems, are part of a record-breaking payout. Shirley Bodkin said she was sexually abused by staff at a Los Angeles County foster care facility decades ago. “No child should have to experience what I did,” she said. Credit...Mark Abramson for The New York Times Supported by By Shawn Hubler and Shaila Dewan Shawn Hubler reported from Los Angeles, and Shaila Dewan from New York. MaryAlice Ashbrook remembers the rain on the night the Los Angeles police retrieved her, the 8-year-old child of a pill-addicted mother, and took her to the MacLaren Children’s Center, the county-run foster home where she was preyed upon. Shirley Bodkin remembers the smell of the staff member there who would put her on his lap and make her hold a Raggedy Ann doll while he hurt her. J.C. Wright remembers the social workers who accused him, at age 7, of “fabricating” when he tried telling them what a doctor there had done to him. Those memories are decades old. Ms. Ashbrook is 65 now, a retired bookkeeper in Yuma, Ariz. Ms. Bodkin is 58, the mother of two grown sons in the Southern California beach town of Dana Point. Mr. Wright is 42, a truck driver and father of four in suburban Los Angeles. Whole chapters of their lives have gone by — marriages, children, careers — yet the memories have never ceased to torment them. Ms. Ashbrook tried electroshock therapy. Ms. Bodkin attempted suicide. Mr. Wright lived on the streets for years, ending up in prison. There was no escaping the nightmares, they said in interviews on Sunday. So they turned to the courts for some measure of relief. Last week, it arrived, for them and nearly 7,000 other plaintiffs who say they were sexually abused as children in Los Angeles County’s juvenile detention and foster care systems, in cases dating to the late 1950s. In a settlement that lawyers say is the largest of its kind in the nation, the county publicly apologized and agreed to pay a record $4 billion, dwarfing previous settlements in child sex abuse cases brought against the Boy Scouts of America and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The wave of claims — so immense that officials had warned before the deal that Los Angeles County, the nation’s most populous, could be bankrupted by it — came after California gave childhood victims a new window to sue, even though the statute of limitations had expired. The county’s Board of Supervisors is expected to formally approve the payout on April 29. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"A fight over the testimony of Elizabeth G. Oyer could have a ripple effect on whether other fired Justice Department lawyers speak publicly about their experiences.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by A fight over the testimony of Elizabeth G. Oyer could have a ripple effect on whether other fired Justice Department lawyers speak publicly about their experiences. By Devlin Barrett Reporting from Washington Senior officials at the Justice Department have claimed that executive privilege should bar a lawyer dismissed from the department from testifying to Congress about a disagreement with supervisors over restoring the gun rights of Mel Gibson, the actor and prominent supporter of President Trump. Nevertheless, Elizabeth G. Oyer, the department’s former pardon attorney, appeared before lawmakers on Monday afternoon. “I am here because I will not be bullied into concealing the ongoing corruption and abuse of power at the Department of Justice,” she told Democratic senators and representatives. The dispute began on Friday night, when a lawyer in the office of the deputy attorney general warned Ms. Oyer that she was “not authorized to disclose” records about the firearms-rights issue to lawmakers, according to a letter reviewed by The New York Times. A lawyer for Ms. Oyer responded in kind, accusing the department of trying to intimidate a whistle-blower on the cusp of a congressional hearing. The department’s argument that internal conversations are covered by executive privilege — a legal doctrine meant to keep some discussions in the executive branch off-limits to the other branches of government — could have consequences for many other former Justice Department lawyers. Already, the department has fired dozens of career prosecutors, some of whom have spoken publicly about their experiences, while others may yet do so. On the same day that the department informed Ms. Oyer of its plans, she also learned that deputy U.S. marshals would be sent to her home to deliver the department’s letter. After Ms. Oyer assured officials that she had received it via email, the delivery was canceled. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"A full appeals court panel voted 7-4 to restore Cathy Harris and Gwynne Wilcox to their positions, setting up an expected Supreme Court finale.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by A full appeals court panel voted 7-4 to restore Cathy Harris and Gwynne Wilcox to their positions, setting up an expected Supreme Court finale. By Zach Montague Reporting from Washington A federal appeals court in Washington voted Monday to reinstate the heads of two independent government agencies that oversee labor disputes, extending a legal standoff touched off by President Trump’s attempt to fire them. The boards work to protect the rights of federal employees and unionized workers, and the once-obscure bodies have been thrust into the spotlight as Mr. Trump moves quickly to cut thousands of jobs and strip federal workers of the protections that have proven obstacles to his downsizing efforts. The decision hinged on a contested legal precedent that shields the officers of these types of boards from political pressure by preventing them from being removed without cause. It tees up an expected finale in which the Supreme Court will be asked to issue the final word on whether Mr. Trump can unilaterally shake up the boards’ leadership. By a 7-4 vote, the court voided an earlier decision by a divided three-judge panel that had cleared the way for the Trump administration to remove Cathy Harris and Gwynne A. Wilcox — both appointed by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — from their posts at the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board. Both women found themselves targets of the president amid his broader campaign to centralize power and eliminate constraints on his ability to fire federal workers and decimate the federal service.

The justices are expected to act in the coming days. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. on Monday temporarily blocked a trial judge’s order directing the United States to return a Salvadoran migrant it had inadvertently deported. The chief justice, acting on his own, issued an “administrative stay,” an interim measure meant to give the justices some breathing room while the full court considers the matter. The order came just hours after the administration asked the court to block the trial judge’s order instructing the government to return the migrant, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, by 11:59 p.m. on Monday. Judge Paula Xinis of the Federal District Court in Maryland had said the administration committed a “grievous error” that “shocks the conscience” by sending Mr. Abrego Garcia, to a notorious prison in El Salvador last month. In the administration’s emergency application, D. John Sauer, the U.S. solicitor general, said Judge Xinis had exceeded her authority by engaging in “district-court diplomacy,” because it would require working with the government of El Salvador to secure his release. “If this precedent stands,” he wrote, “other district courts could order the United States to successfully negotiate the return of other removed aliens anywhere in the world by close of business,” he wrote. “Under that logic, district courts would effectively have extraterritorial jurisdiction over the United States’ diplomatic relations with the whole world.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Inside the department’s civil division, litigators are squeezed between judges demanding answers and bosses’ instructions to protect the Trump agenda at all costs.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Inside the department’s civil division, litigators are squeezed between judges demanding answers and bosses’ instructions to protect the Trump agenda at all costs. By Devlin Barrett and Glenn Thrush Reporting from Washington The Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to enact major elements of its agenda have led to a series of courtroom clashes between increasingly skeptical judges and the beleaguered lawyers responsible for defending the government’s positions, which some have come to see as indefensible. The Justice Department’s thinned-out civil division has borne the brunt of the growing conflict. Inside the division, the strains of pushing the legal limits on topics as varied as mass deportations, spending power and punishing law firms are taking a major toll. Government litigators, their ranks increasingly depleted, often find themselves in court with few facts to defend policies they cannot explain, according to current and former officials. Career lawyers representing the government have a long tradition of arguing for the goals of Republican or Democratic administrations, regardless of their personal views. What is different now, they say, is that they increasingly feel trapped between President Trump’s partisan political appointees, who insist on a maximalist approach, and judges who demand comprehensible answers to basic questions. The most vivid example of this squeeze came on Saturday when one of the department’s senior immigration lawyers, Erez Reuveni, was suspended indefinitely after speaking candidly about the administration’s mistaken deportation of a Maryland man to a notorious megaprison in El Salvador. A day earlier, Mr. Reuveni appeared in a federal courtroom in Maryland, where, under pressure from a judge, he alternated between exasperation and concern, conceding that the deportation last month of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia should never have happened. He asked for 24 hours to persuade his client, the Trump administration, to begin efforts to return Mr. Abrego Garcia to the United States. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Amanda Holpuch A transgender woman was arrested at the Florida State Capitol last month after she used a bathroom there to protest a state law that blocks transgender people from using a rest room that aligns with their gender identity. The transgender woman, Marcy Rheintgen, 20, said on Sunday that she had intentionally broken the law. Civil rights experts said that this was the first known case of someone being arrested for challenging a law that bans transgender people from using bathrooms in government buildings that do not align with their gender at birth. Ms. Rheintgen said she had been feeling emotional about what she described as dehumanizing language used by elected officials to talk about transgender people when the idea came to her: “What if I just broke the law because the law is so stupid?” Ms. Rheintgen said that she sent 160 letters to state representatives, the attorney general and governor to tell them when she would use the bathroom and asked that she not be arrested. She arrived at the bathroom on the second floor of the House office building of the Capitol in Tallahassee on March 19. Two police officers spoke to Ms. Rheintgen outside the bathroom and told her that she would be given a trespass warning if she entered, according to an arrest report from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

"A request for proposals for new detention facilities and other services would allow the government to expedite the contracting process and rapidly expand detention.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by A request for proposals for new detention facilities and other services would allow the government to expedite the contracting process and rapidly expand detention. By Allison McCannAlexandra Berzon and Hamed Aleaziz The Trump administration is seeking to spend tens of billions of dollars to set up the machinery to expand immigrant detention on a scale never before seen in the United States, according to a request for proposals posted online by the administration last week. The request, which comes from the Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement, calls for contractors to submit proposals to provide new detention facilities, transportation, security guards, medical support and other administrative services worth as much as $45 billion over the next two years. ICE does not yet have that much money itself. But if funded, the maximum value would represent more than a sixfold increase in spending to detain immigrants. It is the latest indication that President Trump and his administration are laying the groundwork to rapidly follow through on his promise for a mass campaign to rid the country of undocumented immigrants. The sprawling request to contractors was posted last week with a deadline of Monday. In the last fiscal year, D.H.S. allocated about $3.4 billion for the entire custody operation overseen by ICE. ICE is already expecting a large windfall from the G.O.P. budget plan, which Senate Republicans approved on Saturday. That measure lays out a significant spending increase for the administration’s immigration agenda — up to $175 billion over the next 10 years to the committees overseeing immigration enforcement, among other things. The $45 billion request to contractors would put ICE in a position to more readily spend those funds. The request also invites the Defense Department to use its own money for immigrant detention under the same plan. 50,000 47,900 40,000 Funded detention beds 30,000 20,000 Total detainee population 10,000 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 50,000 47,900 40,000 Funded detention beds 30,000 20,000 Total detainee population 10,000 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 HTML_TAG_START Note: The total detainee population is as of Mar. 23 and has been rounded.

"Prosecutors said the men allowed dozens of cars with undocumented immigrants to pass through their inspection lanes in Southern California in exchange for cash.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Prosecutors said the men allowed dozens of cars with undocumented immigrants to pass through their inspection lanes in Southern California in exchange for cash. By Johnny Diaz Two U.S. border protection officers in Southern California have been charged with taking thousands of dollars in bribes to allow people to enter the country through the country’s busiest land port of entry without showing proper documents, prosecutors said. The officers, Farlis Almonte and Ricardo Rodriguez, were charged on March 24 with conspiracy to bring in aliens for financial gain, bringing in aliens for financial gain and receipt of bribes by a public official, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California. An investigation began after several smugglers who were arrested in September told investigators they had been working with U.S. border inspectors, according to a criminal complaint that was unsealed on March 25. As U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers, Mr. Almonte and Mr. Rodriguez were assigned to immigration inspection booths at the San Ysidro Port of Entry in Southern California, the complaint said. They were charged after investigators found text messages that showed they had informed human smugglers in Mexico when they were scheduled to work and what lanes they were assigned to in exchange for thousands of dollars, the complaint said. The scheme lasted from August 2024 through January 2025, prosecutors said. Investigators said that both men deposited “abnormal amounts of cash in the latter half of 2024” into their accounts. Mr. Almonte appeared to have deposited almost $22,000 in cash, broken into small deposits, while Mr. Rodriguez deposited about $24,000, also in small deposits, investigators said. After Mr. Almonte was in custody, investigators seized nearly $70,000 in cash that they believe his romantic partner was trying to move to Tijuana, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported. In one case during an evening in December, a driver with four passengers entered a lane that Mr. Almonte was monitoring when he was presented identification and “noticed that the documents did not appear to have been issued to the passengers” but still waved them through, the complaint said. “Those four were later determined to be aliens without documents allowing them to enter or remain in the United States,” according to the complaint. In another episode, surveillance video recorded a vehicle with a driver and a passenger at a checkpoint but only the driver had proper documentation, the complaint said. The officers “failed to perform their official duties, often admitting without any meaningful inspection cars with multiple passengers, while documenting that only the drivers were present,” the complaint said. Lawyers for Mr. Almonte and Mr. Rodriguez did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday. “Any Customs and Border Protection agent who aids or turns a blind eye to smugglers bringing undocumented immigrants into the U.S. is betraying their oath and endangering our national security,” the acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California, Andrew Haden, said in a statement. “Those who engage in such misconduct will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” Susan C.

By Benjamin OreskesZolan Kanno-Youngs and Hamed Aleaziz Benjamin Oreskes reported from Albany, N.Y. Zolan Kanno-Youngs and Hamed Aleaziz reported from Washington. During President Trump’s first months in office, officials in his administration have used the threat of withholding federal funding to bend institutions and municipalities to their ideological will. That strategy shows no signs of abating. The Department of Homeland Security is reviewing billions of dollars in grants for cities and states to make sure recipients comply with Mr. Trump’s priorities on immigration enforcement and diversity programs. Now grant beneficiaries must “honor requests for cooperation, such as participation in joint operations, sharing of information or requests for short-term detention of an alien pursuant to a valid detainer,” according to the terms and conditions for grants distributed by the department. The terms and conditions, which were first released last October and quietly updated in late March, also mandate that those who receive grants “will provide access to detainees, such as when an immigration officer seeks to interview a person who might be a removable alien.” “I see it as the beginning of the reshaping of our national emergency management infrastructure,” said Mark Ghilarducci, who previously served as California’s state emergency services director. “Now it will be based upon ideology versus what is the actual need.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Dozens of foreign governments were trying to appeal to the president to have steep tariffs rolled back, but the president and his advisers have indicated negotiations could be difficult.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by Dozens of foreign governments were trying to appeal to the president to have steep tariffs rolled back, but the president and his advisers have indicated negotiations could be difficult. By Ana SwansonAlexandra StevensonDamien Cave and Jeanna Smialek Ana Swanson reported from Washington, Alexandra Stevenson from Manila, Damien Cave from Ho Chi Minh City and Jeanna Smialek from Brussels. President Trump’s plan to impose sweeping tariffs on most of America’s trading partners has governments across the globe racing to schedule phone calls, send delegations to Washington and offer up proposals to lower their import taxes in order to escape the levies. On Monday, European officials offered to drop tariffs to zero on cars and industrial goods imported from the United States, in return for the same treatment. Israel’s prime minister was expected to personally petition Mr. Trump on Monday in meetings at the White House. Vietnam’s top leader, in a phone call last week, offered to get rid of tariffs on American goods, while Indonesia prepared to send a high-level delegation to Washington, D.C., to “directly negotiate with the U.S. government.” Even Lesotho, the tiny landlocked country in Southern Africa, was assembling a delegation to send to Washington to protest the tariffs on its exports to the United States, which include denim for Calvin Klein and Levi’s. Mr. Trump and his advisers have given mixed signals on whether the United States is willing to negotiate. On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that the tariffs would remain in place until U.S. trade deficits disappeared, meaning the United States is no longer buying more from these countries than it sells to them. But the administration still appeared to be welcoming offers from foreign nations, which are desperate to try to forestall more levies that go into effect on Wednesday. On Monday, as markets recoiled for a third day and Mr. Trump threatened even more punishing tariffs on China, the president said that “negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately.” “Countries from all over the World are talking to us,” the president wrote on Truth Social on Monday morning. “Tough but fair parameters are being set.

"Republicans who had been poised to force a vote on changing House rules to allow new parents to vote remotely pulled back after the speaker offered a narrower solution for new mothers.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Republicans who had been poised to force a vote on changing House rules to allow new parents to vote remotely pulled back after the speaker offered a narrower solution for new mothers. By Annie Karni Reporting from Washington Speaker Mike Johnson has reached an agreement with Republican holdouts that will effectively kill a bipartisan effort to change House rules so that lawmakers could temporarily vote remotely immediately after the birth of a child. Instead, Mr. Johnson has committed to allowing a convoluted arrangement to give a narrow group of lawmakers — women who face medical complications after childbirth that prevent them from being present in Washington — a way of registering their position on some legislation in their absence without actually being able to vote. The maneuver, known as “vote pairing,” would not require a rule change and is a far cry from allowing new parents in Congress to fully participate in legislating. But it will allow Mr. Johnson to dispense with an issue that had exposed a deep cultural rift among House Republicans and temporarily paralyzed President Trump’s legislative agenda. The agreement came after Mr. Johnson persuaded Mr. Trump, who initially said he supported proxy voting for new mothers, to back him in opposition to the practice, which was vehemently opposed by the speaker and a sizable contingent of hard-right Republicans. Republicans have long asserted that proxy voting — when lawmakers who are not at the Capitol can designate a colleague to cast a vote on their behalf — is unconstitutional and destroys the fabric of the institution of Congress, which requires lawmakers to convene in person. “If you aren’t capable of doing the job your constituents sent you to do, then you should step aside and let someone else do it,” Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, said last week as she argued against any form of proxy voting.

"A razor-close race for a seat on the court is the last 2024 statewide election in the nation to remain uncertified.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by A razor-close race for a seat on the court is the last 2024 statewide election in the nation to remain uncertified. By Nick Corasaniti and Eduardo Medina The North Carolina Supreme Court temporarily blocked a lower court’s order from taking effect on Monday that would have required tens of thousands of people who voted in 2024 to verify their eligibility. The higher court stayed that order while it considers an appeal in a long-running dispute over the election. The ruling on Monday is the latest twist in a five-month battle over a seat on the very same State Supreme Court. Justice Allison Riggs, the Democratic incumbent, won the election in November over Judge Jefferson Griffin, the Republican challenger, by 734 votes. Judge Griffin has challenged the result, seeking to dismiss the ballots cast by roughly 65,000 people. He has argued that a majority of them were ineligible to vote because they did not supply certain required identification data when they registered — though the omission was because of administrative errors and no fault of the voters. The race is the last 2024 statewide election in the nation that remains uncertified. On Friday, a state appeals court sided with Judge Griffin, ruling that the challenged voters must verify or correct their registration information within a 15-day window or have their ballots thrown out. That ruling was set to take effect at 5 p.m. on Monday. Because many of the affected voters live in Democratic-leaning counties, discarding their ballots could potentially have overturned the results of the election. Justice Riggs and the North Carolina State Election Board immediately said they would appeal, and asked the State Supreme Court to issue a stay to halt the registration-fixing effort, and to review the appellate court’s ruling. Judge Griffin’s legal team did not oppose the request for a stay, but even so the higher court waited until Monday to take action. Dory MacMillan, a spokeswoman for Justice Riggs, welcomed the Supreme Court order in a statement on Monday afternoon. “We will continue to pursue this appeal and are committed to ensuring that power stays in the hands of voters — not politicians,” Ms. MacMillan said. A representative for Mr. Griffin declined to comment. In a separate statement on Monday, the chairman of the state Republican Party, Jason Simmons, said that “the people of our state deserve to see this important election finalized with every legal vote counted.” The stunning ruling on Friday sparked confusion among voters and local election officials across the state. County and state election offices were already being contacted on Monday by voters seeking to fix any issues with their ballots. The North Carolina State Board of Elections said it would issue guidance to local officials about the registration-fixing effort if necessary. Patrick Gannon, a spokesman, said in a statement on Monday that if the appellate ruling ultimately did take effect, his agency “will provide detailed instructions to the county boards of elections and affected voters on how to comply with the court’s decision.” Nick Corasaniti is a Times reporter covering national politics, with a focus on voting and elections.

"The federal lawsuit is the latest escalation of Gov. Janet Mills’s standoff with the Trump administration over the issue of transgender athletes.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The federal lawsuit is the latest escalation of Gov. Janet Mills’s standoff with the Trump administration over the issue of transgender athletes. By Jenna Russell The State of Maine sued the Agriculture Department on Monday, arguing that the agency violated the law when it froze funding to Maine last week and that the freeze threatened school meal programs. The suit, filed in Federal District Court, is the latest escalation of Maine’s standoff with the Trump administration over transgender athletes, which began when President Trump chastised Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, at the White House in February. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to punish the state if it does not comply with his executive order banning transgender women from women’s sports. The federal government maintains that a Maine law prohibiting discrimination against transgender people, and the state’s policy of allowing transgender athletes to play on women’s teams, are violations of Title IX, the civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in education. “You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, wrote in a letter to Ms. Mills last week, according to the lawsuit. “This is only the beginning, though you are free to end it at any time by protecting women and girls in compliance with federal law.” Aaron Frey, Maine’s attorney general, argues in the state’s lawsuit that Title IX does not prohibit transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports. In fact, the complaint says, federal courts have held that civil rights laws require schools to allow such participation. The state contends that the Agriculture Department did not follow required procedures before freezing the funding. Because the funding covers salaries for workers who run the statewide school meals program, and the cost of their phones and computers, the lawsuit states, halting it threatens the program. “Under the banner of keeping children safe, the Trump administration is illegally withholding grant funds that go to keeping children fed,” Mr. Frey said in a statement, adding that “this action is necessary to remind the president that Maine will not be bullied into violating the law.” The state is seeking an emergency court order to restore the funding.

Now the firm is among those that have been pushed to agree to a deal with the White House. By Maggie HabermanBen Protess and Michael S. Schmidt As a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, Wall Street’s oldest law firm, Todd Blanche had represented people close to President Trump over the years. But in 2023, when Mr. Trump was facing multiple criminal investigations and Mr. Blanche wanted to represent him, most of the firm’s leadership balked at the idea, according to people with knowledge of the matter. So, Mr. Blanche left Cadwalader, hanging out his own legal shingle and expressing bitterness to some allies that he had to do so to take on Mr. Trump as a client, one of the people said. While Mr. Blanche’s loyalty earned him a reward — Mr. Trump appointed him deputy attorney general — Cadwalader is now bracing for some blowback. As the White House ramps up its attacks on major law firms — imposing executive orders against some and striking deals with others — Cadwalader recently learned that it might become ensnared in Mr. Trump’s wide-ranging crackdown, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions. One of Mr. Trump’s advisers has been in touch with the firm to suggest that it sign a deal in which it would offer tens of millions of dollars in pro bono legal services to causes that the Trump administration supports.

"The local authorities arrested Karl Mitchell, who claimed he had been authorized by a doctor to keep the tigers.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The local authorities arrested Karl Mitchell, who claimed he had been authorized by a doctor to keep the tigers. By Livia Albeck-Ripka A Nevada man was arrested last week after seven tigers that he claimed were his emotional support animals were seized from his property, the local authorities said. Karl Mitchell, 71, was arrested on Wednesday at his property in Pahrump, an unincorporated town in Nye County about 50 miles west of Las Vegas, on charges of resisting arrest and possession of a gun by a prohibited person, according to records from the Nye County Sheriff’s Office. A SWAT team had entered the property to seize the tigers, which the Sheriff’s Office said Mr. Mitchell had been keeping without the permit required by the county. Mr. Mitchell refused to provide keys to the tiger cages and was then arrested just before 8 a.m., according to the documents. A handgun was also found in the bedroom of Mr. Mitchell, who is a felon, the Sheriff’s Office said. Mr. Mitchell was released later that evening, according to the records. Sheriff Joe McGill of Nye County told KSNV, the NBC affiliate in Las Vegas, that the investigation into Mr. Mitchell, who was also being evicted from his property, had begun several months ago. “We have known for several years he has had big cats on his property, and for the last two years, this has been in violation because he had no permits for those cats,” Sheriff McGill said. Sheriff McGill added that his office had received information over the years indicating that Mr. Mitchell was seen walking the tigers in and around the property in the desert.

"President Trump pulled out of the last Iran nuclear accord in 2018, and negotiators from the two nations have not met face-to-face since. Now he faces the challenge of dismantling the Iranian program.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by President Trump pulled out of the last Iran nuclear accord in 2018, and negotiators from the two nations have not met face-to-face since. Now he faces the challenge of dismantling the Iranian program. By David E. Sanger and Farnaz Fassihi David E. Sanger has covered the Iranian nuclear program for more than two decades. He reported from Washington. Farnaz Fassihi covers a range of Iranian political and social issues, and reported from New York. President Trump said on Monday that the United States would engage in “direct” negotiations with Iran next Saturday in a last-ditch effort to rein in the country’s nuclear program, saying Tehran would be “in great danger” if it failed to reach an accord. If direct talks take place, they would be the first official face-to-face negotiations between the two countries since Mr. Trump abandoned the Obama-era nuclear accord seven years ago. They would also come at a perilous moment, as Iran has lost the air defenses around its key nuclear sites because of precise Israeli strikes last October. And Iran can no longer rely on its proxy forces in the Middle East — Hamas, Hezbollah and the now-ousted Assad government in Syria — to threaten Israel with retaliation. In a social media post, Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, confirmed that talks would take place on Saturday in Oman, but he said that they would be indirect, meaning intermediaries would work with the two sides. “It is as much an opportunity as it is a test. The ball is in America’s court,” Mr. Araghchi said. On the order of its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran has refused to sit down with American officials in direct nuclear negotiations since Mr. Trump pulled out of the last accord. After Mr. Trump spoke on Monday, however, three Iranian officials said Ayatollah Khamenei had shifted his position to potentially allow direct talks. The officials said that if Saturday’s indirect talks are respectful and productive, then direct talks may happen. The officials asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Still, Iran is almost certain to resist dismantling its entire nuclear infrastructure, which has given it a “threshold” capability to make the fuel for a bomb in a matter of weeks — and perhaps a full weapon in months. Many Iranians have begun to talk openly about the need for the country to build a weapon since it has proved fairly defenseless in a series of missile exchanges with Israel last year.

For many, the reasons are unclear.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Dozens of schools, including the University of California and Harvard, said the Trump administration ended the visas of their students in recent days. For many, the reasons are unclear. By Vimal PatelMiriam Jordan and Halina Bennet Nearly 300 international students were abruptly stripped of their ability to stay in the United States in recent days, according to universities and media reports, sowing fear among students and confusion at schools scrambling to help students facing detention and possible deportation. The moves targeted students at a wide range of universities, from private institutions like Harvard and Stanford to public ones like the University of Texas at Austin and Minnesota State University-Mankato. The University of California had dozens of cases reported across its campuses. Several immigration lawyers told The New York Times that they began receiving frantic emails and calls late last week from students who had been notified by the State Department or their universities that their visas or statuses had been terminated without clear justifications. Criminal convictions have always put students at risk of losing their status, but participation in political actions and committing traffic infractions have rarely been cited as justifications. In some cases, immigration officers have arrested international students related to their involvement in pro-Palestinian causes. In other cases, students had committed legal infractions, such as driving over the speed limit or while intoxicated, often years ago, several immigration lawyers said in interviews. But lawyers said the Trump administration had often given no reason at all, leaving them to guess why students were targeted. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Elon Musk has been criticizing Trump’s tariff policy — and publicly. Could there be a strategy?",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Newsletter Elon Musk has been criticizing Trump’s tariff policy — and publicly. Could there be a strategy? By Theodore Schleifer Elon Musk is known for many things. Subtlety is not one of them. When Musk shared a grainy two-minute video at 4:59 a.m. Monday to his 218 million followers, his post contained no words, and yet the message was clear. It showed the free-market intellectual Milton Friedman, in a 1980 clip well known to economists, waxing poetic about free trade as he sketched out the international origins of the parts that form a pencil. Musk was expressing his discomfort with President Trump’s imposition of draconian new tariffs. And yet one has to wonder what Musk hopes to accomplish. This is not a president known to brook much public criticism, after all. Try to imagine Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, subtweeting her boss. And Musk repeatedly went out of his way to disagree with Trump over the weekend, suggesting he believes he is not subject to the same rules that govern others in the president’s inner circle. Speaking by video on Saturday to an Italian far-right political conference, he said he hoped the United States and the European Union would “move to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone.” And that came after Musk twice took shots on X at the administration trade hawk Peter Navarro: First, he ridiculed Navarro’s Harvard Ph.D. in economics as “a bad thing, not a good thing,” suggesting it meant Navarro’s ego exceeded his intelligence.

"Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield has joined a list of several leaders who have been purged from the military’s highest ranks.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield has joined a list of several leaders who have been purged from the military’s highest ranks. By Helene Cooper Helene Cooper reports on national security, with a focus on the Pentagon and the U.S. military. The Trump administration fired Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, U.S. officials said on Monday, as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth continued his purge of military leaders who have been targeted by conservatives. Admiral Chatfield, who served in the Navy as the U.S. representative to NATO’s military committee, has joined a list of female leaders and people of color who have been fired. It includes the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr.; the Navy’s former chief, Adm. Lisa Franchetti; Lt. Gen. Jennifer Short, a former senior military assistant to the defense secretary; and the former Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Linda Lee Fagan. Also fired recently were Gen. Timothy D. Haugh, who was commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency, and Gen. James Slife, the former vice chief of staff of the Air Force. It was unclear whether President Trump or Mr. Hegseth gave the order to fire Admiral Chatfield. Last week Mr. Trump removed several national security officials, including General Haugh, after meeting with Laura Loomer, the far-right activist and conspiracy theorist. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on Admiral Chatfield’s firing, which was first reported by Reuters. In a December letter to Mr. Hegseth, a conservative watchdog group included Admiral Chatfield in a list of “woke ideologues” who the group said should be purged. Before moving to NATO, Admiral Chatfield was the first woman to lead the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, R.I. General Haugh was ousted after Ms. Loomer accused him and his deputy of disloyalty, according to U.S. officials and a social media post by Ms. Loomer on Friday. He had been chosen by Gen. Mark A. Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whom Ms. Loomer called a traitor. The firings of senior military leaders have rattled lawmakers and been condemned by former defense secretaries as “reckless.” Helene Cooper is a Pentagon correspondent. She was previously an editor, diplomatic correspondent and White House correspondent.

"The Republican congressman joins a crowded field vying to replace Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is term-limited.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Republican congressman joins a crowded field vying to replace Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is term-limited. By Kellen Browning Representative John James, Republican of Michigan, announced on Monday that he would run for governor, jumping into an increasingly crowded, high-profile contest. In a post on social media, Mr. James tied himself closely to President Trump while criticizing recent Democratic leadership of Michigan as “radical” and “out-of-touch.” “It’s time to get Michigan’s government out of fantasyland and back to common sense,” Mr. James wrote. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat elected in 2018, is term-limited, which has set up a competitive 2026 race to determine her successor in the battleground state. On the Republican side, Mr. James joins Aric Nesbitt, the minority leader in the State Senate. Two prominent Democrats in Ms. Whitmer’s administration, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II and Jocelyn Benson, the secretary of state, have also announced runs for governor. Pete Buttigieg, the former transportation secretary and 2020 Democratic candidate for president who is often mentioned as a likely 2028 presidential contender, said last month that he would not enter the governor’s race, nor would he run for the U.S. Senate seat held by Gary Peters, a Democrat who is retiring. The governor’s race could be further complicated by the candidacy of Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, a longtime Democrat who announced last year that he would run as an independent, an effort to distance himself from the Democratic Party brand after Mr. Trump flipped the state back to the Republican column in the presidential race last November. Closely divided Michigan has seesawed between the two parties in recent years, with voters narrowly electing Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat, to an open Senate seat while at the same time backing Mr. Trump for the presidency. Mr. James, 43, has represented a competitive district in the northern Detroit suburbs since 2023, after previously losing two bids for the Senate. A businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who served in Iraq, he would be Michigan’s first Black governor. In his announcement post, Mr. James underscored his credentials and suggested he would help to reverse a decline in manufacturing jobs in Michigan. “Our state has suffered long enough,” he wrote. In a statement, Sam Newton, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association, dismissed Mr. James as a right-wing politician who supports policies that would harm Michiganders. “John James has spent his time in Congress putting his own extreme partisan politics first, and now he’s running to bring the chaos and dysfunction of D.C. to Michigan,” Mr. Newton said.

"Democrats have argued that Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, did not act faster to fill the vacant seat because he didn’t want the narrow Republicans majority in Congress to shrink.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Democrats have argued that Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, did not act faster to fill the vacant seat because he didn’t want the narrow Republicans majority in Congress to shrink. By J. David Goodman An election to fill a vacant House seat in a heavily Democratic district in Texas will take place in November, Gov. Greg Abbott said on Monday, ensuring that the seat will remain unoccupied for most of the year as Republican leaders try to secure President Trump’s agenda. Democrats have complained that Mr. Abbott did not act faster to fill the seat in Houston after the death of Representative Sylvester Turner last month so that Republicans could pass a contentious budget through the narrowly divided House. They accused the governor of deliberately delaying the announcement of a special election until after a deadline had passed to set the election for May. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leader, said Mr. Abbott was “openly conspiring with House Republicans to rig the system and disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Harris County residents.” But Mr. Abbott said that his decision to wait had been based on what he said was a desire to give election officials in Harris County, where the district is, more time to prepare. “No county in Texas does a worse job of conducting elections than Harris County,” Mr. Abbott said in a statement. “Forcing Harris County to rush this special election on weeks’ notice would harm the interests of voters.” Republicans have a narrow 220-213 margin in the House. A special election has been scheduled for July to fill a vacant seat in a heavily Democratic district in Arizona after the death of Representative Raúl M. Grijalva. The vacant seat in Texas is widely expected to be filled by a Democrat. Mr. Abbott has the power to schedule an emergency special election, even after the May deadline passed. Candidates for the open seat had hoped that he would schedule the vote for June. Instead he opted to wait for the next regularly scheduled election on Nov. 4. Political observers said that was in keeping with the law and with Mr. Abbott’s political goal of assisting his fellow Republicans in Washington. But Democrats were not happy. “It is unconscionable to leave nearly 800,000 people in this district without representation in Congress for most of the year,” said Christian Menefee, the Harris County attorney and a Democratic candidate for the House seat. “Governor Abbott knows how to move quickly — he’s done it for other districts,” Mr. Menefee said, citing a special election in the Rio Grande Valley that the governor called for the summer of 2022, which a Republican won. “He just chose not to for us.” J. David Goodman is the Houston bureau chief for The Times, reporting on Texas and Oklahoma.

"A majority of the justices concluded that the Venezuelan migrants had brought their cases in the wrong court but that they were entitled to an opportunity to challenge their removal.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by A majority of the justices concluded that the Venezuelan migrants had brought their cases in the wrong court but that they were entitled to an opportunity to challenge their removal. By Abbie VanSickle Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court ruled on Monday night that the Trump administration could continue to deport Venezuelan migrants using a wartime powers act for now, overturning a lower court that had put a temporary stop to the deportations. The decision marks a victory for the Trump administration, although the ruling did not address the constitutionality of using the Alien Enemies Act to send the migrants to a prison in El Salvador. The justices instead issued a narrow procedural ruling, saying that the migrants’ lawyers had filed their lawsuit in the wrong court. The justices said it should have been filed in Texas, where the Venezuelans are being held, rather than a court in Washington. All nine justices agreed that the Venezuelan migrants detained in the United States must receive advance notice and the opportunity to challenge their deportation before they could be removed, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote in a concurrence. The split among the court was over where — and how — that should happen. “The detainees are confined in Texas, so venue is improper in the District of Columbia,” according to the court’s order, which was brief and unsigned, as is typical in such emergency applications. The justices ordered that the Venezuelan migrants must be told that they were subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act “within a reasonable time” for them to challenge their removal before they are deported. That finding could impose significant new restrictions on how the Trump administration might attempt to use the act in the future. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Taken together, they signal an abrupt reversal from efforts by the Biden administration to stem the flood of unregulated semiautomatic handguns and rifles.",2025-04-07,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Taken together, they signal an abrupt reversal from efforts by the Biden administration to stem the flood of unregulated semiautomatic handguns and rifles. By Glenn Thrush Reporting from Washington The Trump administration is expected to roll back a range of Biden-era gun control measures, including a program to crack down on federally licensed gun dealers who falsify business records and skip customer background checks, according to two people briefed on the move. Attorney General Pam Bondi, under pressure from gun rights groups, is likely to announce this week that she plans to eliminate the “zero tolerance” policy, put in place four years ago, that strips the federal licenses of firearms dealers found to have repeatedly violated federal laws and regulations, the people said. Ms. Bondi plans to order Kash Patel, who is serving as F.B.I. director and the interim leader of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to review two other major policies enacted under the Biden administration, with an eye toward scrapping both. One is a ban on so-called pistol braces used to convert handguns into rifle-like weapons, and the second is a rule requiring background checks on private gun sales. The moves come at a moment of chaos at a largely leaderless and rudderless A.T.F., whose small work force has been partly redeployed to provide support for immigration raids around the country. Mr. Patel has spent most of his time running the F.B.I., and the Justice Department has proposed merging the gun agency with the Drug Enforcement Administration, a plan that has left the A.T.F.’s career leadership demoralized. That, however, is unlikely to take place anytime soon. President Trump campaigned on curtailing gun regulation. In February, he signed an executive order directing the Justice Department “to examine all orders, regulations, guidance, plans” and other actions “to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens.” In late March, Ms. Bondi ordered the department’s civil rights division to open an investigation into the potential infringement of Second Amendment rights by officials in Los Angeles County, repurposing an investigative unit that had been used to expose racial discrimination and police violence by local enforcement agencies.

Investigators in Perry, Ga., said the four victims, who ranged in age from 2 to 82, were related. By Neil Vigdor A person of interest has been questioned in the killings last week of four family members at a trailer park in a small city in Georgia, according to the authorities, who said on Monday that they could not recall a quadruple homicide having occurred there before. Investigators say that the victims, whose ages ranged from 2 to 82, were discovered during a wellness check on Friday evening at the Timberline Mobile Home Park in Perry, Ga., a community of about 24,000 residents roughly 100 miles south of Atlanta. Three of them had been stabbed and a fourth was suffocated, Capt. Jason Jones, a spokesman for the Perry Police Department, said in a phone interview on Monday. The person of interest, a man, knew at least one of the victims, and the killings appeared to have stemmed from a domestic dispute, he said. The police said the killings appeared to have been an isolated crime and said that there was no active danger to the community. “We may have one or two homicides a year at the most,” Captain Jones said. “That type of violence is just not commonplace here in Perry or in Houston County.” The authorities identified the victims on Monday as Tuquondea Robinson, 37; Michelle Joiner, 51; Beaulah Robinson, 82; and A’laoiah Joiner, a 2-year-old girl. The three adults were immediate family members: a grandmother, her daughter and granddaughter, Capt. Jones said. The toddler had been staying with them because of domestic issues, which he said were unrelated to the killings. The eldest of the four victims, Ms. Robinson, had been bedridden and was suffocated, Captain Jones said. Local law enforcement officers said that they were working with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to solve the crime. “We’ve still got several pieces of the puzzle to put together,” Captain Jones said.

"A video showed the former British prime minister yelping and uttering a profanity after the ostrich pecked him through a window at what appeared to be a wildlife park.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by A video showed the former British prime minister yelping and uttering a profanity after the ostrich pecked him through a window at what appeared to be a wildlife park. By Livia Albeck-Ripka Boris Johnson, the former British prime minister, was cruising slowly through what appeared to be a wildlife park when, without warning, the ostrich stuck its head through the open driver’s side window to give Mr. Johnson a feisty peck. “Ow!” Mr. Johnson can be heard shouting, as his toddler giggles with amusement. The incident was shared on Sunday in a video posted to Instagram by Mr. Johnson’s wife, Carrie Johnson, accompanied by the caption, “Too funny not to share 😂.” In the clip, after Mr. Johnson yelps, he seems to express some profanities (though they are somewhat inaudible). He then grabs the steering wheel and drives away. The toddler hanging from Mr. Johnson’s arm keeps giggling. It was not immediately clear on Monday when or where exactly the video had been taken, though social media posts by Ms. Johnson and local sightings show the family on vacation in Texas. Other videos posted to Ms. Johnson’s account that appear to be from the same location show the family looking at deer and an aoudad, a goat-like animal. Another recent post from Ms. Johnson showed the family at Dinosaur Valley State Park, near Glen Rose, Texas. Mr. Johnson was in Texas less than two years ago to lobby for Republican support for Ukraine. It is not the first time Mr. Johnson, who served as prime minister from 2019 until 2022, has been at the center of slapstick public mishaps that align with his colorful and oftentimes chaotic tenure as Britain’s leader. In February 2021, Mr. Johnson struggled to put a latex glove on his hand at a vaccination center in Wales. It’s “like O.J. Simpson,” Mr. Johnson quipped, referring to the 1995 murder trial in which a glove, which was a key piece of evidence, did not fit Mr. Simpson. In July of that year, Mr. Johnson struggled to control his umbrella at a police memorial unveiling in central England. Representatives for Mr. Johnson’s family could not immediately be reached on Monday for comment regarding the incident. Several wildlife parks in the area also did not immediately respond to requests for information about whether the Johnson family had visited them. Stumpy’s Lakeside Grill, a restaurant in Granbury, Texas, posted a photo of Mr. Johnson to social media on Saturday, noting that he had dined there. “We are so honored to have him as our guest!!” the restaurant said.

His sister is pushing several states to ban such nondisclosure agreements. The childhood desk of Trey Carlock inside his family home in Dallas. Mr. Carlock died by suicide after he was sexually abused at a summer camp.Credit... Supported by By David W. Chen Photographs by Desiree Rios Reporting from Austin, Texas, and Dallas Like the children of many affluent evangelical families in Dallas, Elizabeth Carlock Phillips and her younger brother Trey Carlock spent their summers at a Christian sports camp in Missouri. After Mr. Carlock suffered years of sexual abuse by one of the camp’s directors, he reached a financial settlement to compensate him for his trauma, but at a suffocating price: He could never tell anyone about what had happened. Mr. Carlock, a neuroscience researcher, cycled in and out of more than a dozen hospitals and treatment centers, and tried electroconvulsive therapy. He became increasingly detached from family and friends, and took his own life in August 2019. He was 28. “Trey told a therapist, ‘They will always control me, and I’ll never be free,’” said Ms. Phillips, who added that the family still had no idea what his nondisclosure agreement had dictated, or what truly had happened to him. “He called his settlement dollars blood money, because taking that money in exchange for an NDA felt like a bribe.” She added, “He was silenced to his grave.” Thanks to the efforts of Ms. Phillips and other victims’ relatives, Texas and Missouri are among several states now aiming to ban such nondisclosure agreements in cases of childhood sexual assault. To critics, the agreements impose a lifetime gag order and deny survivors the ability to heal by sharing their trauma. They also shield perpetrators and the institutions that effectively protect them, allowing abusers to prey upon more unknowing children. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The billionaire’s gun control group plans to spend $10 million to help elect Democratic attorneys general, who are on the front lines of legal clashes with the president.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The billionaire’s gun control group plans to spend $10 million to help elect Democratic attorneys general, who are on the front lines of legal clashes with the president. By Reid J. Epstein Reporting from Washington Michael R. Bloomberg’s gun control group plans to spend $10 million to help elect Democratic attorneys general this year and in 2026, an investment it says is meant to help protect the rule of law and democracy while President Trump holds the White House. The group, Everytown for Gun Safety, will back Democratic candidates in 10 competitive states, including Virginia this fall and Arizona, Georgia, Minnesota, Nevada and Wisconsin, among others, next year, according to John Feinblatt, the organization’s president. The pledged spending from a group fueled by Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and a Democratic megadonor, is notable because of his apparent reluctance to put his money behind Vice President Kamala Harris last year. He spent months resisting entreaties to donate, though fellow billionaires persuaded him to give $50 million in late October to a nonprofit group supporting her campaign. Everytown has for years spent money on down-ballot efforts to elect Democratic candidates for state legislatures, particularly in places where gun control measures had a chance of being enacted and where smaller sums of money could have an influence on races. Mr. Feinblatt said that his group’s push to support attorneys general, which will be called the Everytown Rule of Law Fund, would focus on defending states from actions by the Trump administration more than on serving as an offensive playbook for enacting gun control measures. Attorneys general “are trying to protect the rule of law,” Mr. Feinblatt said. “They’re trying to protect the things that are in every basic textbook of American democracy.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Other government pages have been changed or deleted amid efforts to scrub references to diversity and inclusion. By Sara Ruberg A National Park Service web page about the Underground Railroad appeared to have been restored on Monday to prominently show the abolitionist leader Harriet Tubman, after it had been changed in recent months to remove a large photo and quotations from her. The page appeared to have been changed in February to instead show images of postage stamps that highlighted “Black/white cooperation.” New text emphasized that the Underground Railroad “bridged the divides of race” and other differences. The changes were first reported by The Washington Post. The National Park Service said in a statement on Tuesday that changes to the page had been made “without approval” from the agency’s leadership, and that the old version had been “immediately restored.” The web page appeared to be one of many on government websites that had recently been edited or erased as the Trump administration worked to purge references to diversity and inclusion. Materials on the Arlington National Cemetery website highlighting the graves of Black and female service members have vanished or been obscured. An article on the Defense Department website devoted to Jackie Robinson’s military career disappeared and then reappeared. And another Defense Department page featuring the biography of Maj. Gen. Charles Calvin Rogers, a Black Army general who received the Medal of Honor, also disappeared before being restored. On Monday, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a Democrat, accused the president of trying to “whitewash” history. “Trump is trying to rewrite the history of the Underground Railroad — even diminishing its conductor, MD’s own Harriet Tubman,” Mr. Van Hollen said in a post on X, formerly Twitter. “The Underground Railroad is an important part of the American story. We cannot let him whitewash it as part of his larger effort to erase our history.” Sara Ruberg covers breaking news and is a member of the 2024-25 class of Times Fellows, a program for journalists early in their careers.

"Not long before he became Virginia’s governor, Glenn Youngkin helped lead, and spoke approvingly of, efforts to improve racial and gender diversity at his private equity firm.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Not long before he became Virginia’s governor, Glenn Youngkin helped lead, and spoke approvingly of, efforts to improve racial and gender diversity at his private equity firm. By Katie Glueck Before Glenn Youngkin was a culture warrior who cheered the demise of diversity, equity and inclusion programs, he was a financial executive who worried about a lack of diversity in his field. “One of the clear challenges in the financial sector broadly is both race and gender diversity,” Mr. Youngkin said in a 2018 interview with Bloomberg Markets, soon after becoming a co-chief executive at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. His company, he noted approvingly, had worked for years to address disparities in representation. “The second we stepped into this role, we emphasized that this approach was not only going to continue,” he added, “but it was going to be one of our key priorities.” Seven years later, Mr. Youngkin is the Republican governor of Virginia, an ambitious conservative who harnessed concerns about classroom instruction on race into political power, and who has energetically embraced President Trump’s hostility to D.E.I. initiatives. “D.E.I. is dead in Virginia,” he declared recently. In tone and emphasis, his transformation has been striking, and more drastic than commonly understood, according to interviews with half a dozen people who worked with Mr. Youngkin during his time leading Carlyle, as well as a review of company statements, official filings and other documentation from that time. But in many ways, the evolution of Mr. Youngkin — who some Republicans hope will run for president — reflects the ever more chameleonic nature of his party at the dawn of a second Trump era.

"President Trump’s next round of tariffs on major trading partners went into effect just after midnight, bringing levies on China to at least 104 percent.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by President Trump’s next round of tariffs on major trading partners went into effect just after midnight, bringing levies on China to at least 104 percent. By Ana Swanson and Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington President Trump’s next round of punishing tariffs on some of America’s largest trading partners went into effect on Wednesday, including stiff new levies that will increase import taxes on Chinese goods by at least 104 percent. Mr. Trump acknowledged on Tuesday that his tariffs had been “somewhat explosive.” But throughout the day he continued to defend his approach, saying that it was encouraging countries with what he calls “unfair” trade practices to offer concessions. “We have a lot of countries coming in to make deals,” he said during remarks at the White House on Tuesday afternoon. At a dinner with Congressional Republicans in Washington later that evening, he said other countries wanted to make a deal with the United States but he was happy just collecting the revenue from tariffs, which he claimed would reach $2 billion a day. “I know what the hell I’m doing,” he said, adding that he would announce “a major tariff on pharmaceuticals” very shortly. The president and top administration officials signaled on Tuesday that the White House was ready to negotiate deals, saying that 70 governments had approached the United States to try to roll the levies back. Mr. Trump said officials would begin talks with Japan, South Korea and other nations. The president, whose punitive and successive tariffs on China have triggered a potentially economically damaging trade war, also said he was open to talking to Beijing about a deal.

"A spokesman for China’s foreign ministry denounced the vice president’s comments as “ignorant and impolite.”",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by A spokesman for China’s foreign ministry denounced the vice president’s comments as “ignorant and impolite.” By Eve Sampson Beijing has denounced Vice President JD Vance’s rhetoric as “ignorant” after he said the United States was borrowing money from “Chinese peasants” in a television interview last week. “China’s position on Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations has been made very clear,” said Lin Jian, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, during a news conference on Tuesday. “It is surprising and sad to hear the vice president say such ignorant and impolite words.” China has remained defiant in the face of the Trump administration’s tariffs and the latest threat from President Trump of an additional 50 percent tariff on Chinese goods unless Beijing reverses its retaliatory levies on U.S. imports. China’s Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday accused the United States of “blackmail,” and said that Beijing would “fight to the end.” In an interview with Fox News last week, Mr. Vance defended the Trump administration’s sweeping global tariffs, asking what the “globalist economy” has given the United States. Answering his own question, Mr. Vance said America was “incurring a huge amount of debt to buy things that other countries make” for its market. “We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture,” he said. Mr. Trump’s new policies, condemned by many international leaders, have wrought havoc on financial markets and spurred experts to issue warnings about inflation. The spiraling trade war between the two countries is poised to be costly to Americans, who last year purchased $440 billion of goods from China, making the country the second-largest source of imports after Mexico.

"A case involving a Venezuelan migrant, Daniel Zacarias Matos, could explore the question of whether President Trump has used the Alien Enemies Act in a lawful manner.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by A case involving a Venezuelan migrant, Daniel Zacarias Matos, could explore the question of whether President Trump has used the Alien Enemies Act in a lawful manner. By Alan Feuer Immigration lawyers are reacting to the Supreme Court’s ruling that declared that any legal challenges to the Trump administration’s plan to use a wartime statute to deport a group of Venezuelan migrants have to be filed where the men are being held. And as they scrambled to adjust on Tuesday, their efforts could be guided by a similar case that is underway in Federal District Court in Brownsville, Texas. It was filed last month by Daniel Zacarias Matos, a Venezuelan migrant who claimed that the administration tried to deport him — without a hearing or an order of removal — under President Trump’s recent proclamation invoking a wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act. In mid-March, Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr., who is handling the case, issued an order stopping Mr. Zacarias Matos from being deported until he could look deeper into the matter. His lawyers and lawyers for the Justice Department are expected to file dueling court papers this month laying out the details of what happened. While the facts in Mr. Zacarias Matos’s case do not line up exactly with those in the cases of the Venezuelan migrants directly affected by the Supreme Court’s ruling, they could shed light on some of those proceedings as they start to move forward, most likely one by one. According to court papers, Mr. Zacarias Matos came to the United States with his 8-year-old daughter in December 2023, seeking asylum from Venezuela. Federal immigration agents took him into custody in October at the El Paso County Jail after he was arrested on charges of violating the terms of his probation on two misdemeanor charges that have since been dismissed, court papers show. Early last month, the papers say, Mr. Zacarias Matos was sent to the El Valle Detention Center in Raymondville, Texas, where the administration was holding scores of Venezuelan migrants they were planning to deport to a prison in El Salvador under the expansive powers of the Alien Enemies Act.

"The former New Hampshire governor had been seen as a top Republican recruit in the liberal-leaning yet competitive state. President Trump had said on Sunday, “I hope he runs.”",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The former New Hampshire governor had been seen as a top Republican recruit in the liberal-leaning yet competitive state. President Trump had said on Sunday, “I hope he runs.” By Shane Goldmacher Reporting from Washington Chris Sununu, the Republican former governor of New Hampshire, announced on Tuesday that he would not run for Senate in 2026, dashing the hopes of President Trump and others in their party that he would help flip a seat in the state after a Democratic senator’s retirement. Mr. Sununu, who served for four two-year terms as governor, was once a vocal critic of Mr. Trump’s — he endorsed Nikki Haley in the 2024 primary race — but the president had warmed to the possibility of luring the popular former governor into the Senate race. “I hope he runs,” Mr. Trump said on Air Force One on Sunday, noting that he had met recently with Mr. Sununu in the Oval Office. “He’s been very nice to me over the last year or so.” Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, announced her retirement last month. Representative Chris Pappas of New Hampshire, a Democrat, recently began a bid to succeed her. The other House member from the state, Representative Maggie Goodlander, has said she is also considering a run. Mr. Sununu, who has flirted with Senate campaigns for years but never actually declared a candidacy, officially pulled himself out of contention on Tuesday. “No, I’m not going to run,” he said in a radio interview on The Pulse of NH, saying it was not right for his family. He said that Republicans could still win, and that he had on Tuesday informed Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, of his decision. “It doesn’t have to be me,” Mr. Sununu said. A spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Maeve Coyle, called it “an embarrassing recruitment failure.” Another potential Republican candidate is Scott Brown, a former senator from Massachusetts, whom Ms. Shaheen needled after she announced her exit, telling Semafor: “He’s making noises.

"The agreement is a major departure from the Internal Revenue Service’s previous stance encouraging migrants to file their taxes.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The agreement is a major departure from the Internal Revenue Service’s previous stance encouraging migrants to file their taxes. By Andrew Duehren Reporting from Washington Several top Internal Revenue Service officials, including the acting commissioner, are preparing to quit after the Trump administration pushed the agency to use its protected tax records to help homeland security officials deport immigrants, according to people familiar with the matter. The agreement between the I.R.S. and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, disclosed in a court filing on Monday, is a fundamental departure from decades of practice at the tax collector, which has sought to keep information submitted by undocumented immigrants confidential. Under the terms of the deal, a partially redacted version of which was submitted in the case, ICE officials can ask the I.R.S. for information about people who have been ordered to leave the United States or whom they are otherwise investigating. The two agencies have not yet shared any information, the filings said. Federal law tightly controls taxpayer information, protecting home addresses, earnings and other data from disclosure even to other government agencies. I.R.S. officials have for weeks raised concerns about the Trump administration’s plan to use the agency to help with deportations, warning it could be illegal in negotiations over the agreement. The deal has fueled further turmoil at the top of the agency, which had already been rocked by mass layoffs and several leadership changes during its busiest period of the year, when millions of Americans file their taxes. Among those leaving is Melanie Krause, the acting leader of the I.R.S., who is expected to take the administration’s latest deferred resignation offer, according to five people familiar with her plans. The planned resignation of Ms. Krause, who took over the agency less than two months ago after another interim leader stepped down, has taken I.R.S. employees by surprise, the people said. Once seen as someone aligned with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, she nevertheless concluded that she was uncomfortable with the direction of the I.R.S. under the Trump administration, the people said. The Washington Post earlier reported her planned departure. Several other top I.R.S. officials, including the chief financial officer, the chief of staff and the chief risk officer, are also leaving or have left the agency in recent days, three of the people familiar with the moves said.

"Conservative fiscal hawks lined up in opposition to the Senate-passed fiscal blueprint, arguing it would add too much to the nation’s debt. Its collapse would threaten President Trump’s agenda.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Conservative fiscal hawks lined up in opposition to the Senate-passed fiscal blueprint, arguing it would add too much to the nation’s debt. Its collapse would threaten President Trump’s agenda. By Catie Edmondson Reporting from the Capitol The fate of a budget blueprint to unlock President Trump’s spending and tax cuts was in doubt in the House on Tuesday as conservative Republicans lined up in opposition to the measure, arguing it would add too much to the nation’s debt. House Republican leaders pressed for a vote as early as Wednesday to move their party’s budget resolution past its next hurdle, after the Senate pushed through the measure in an overnight weekend session. The action would clear the way for the G.O.P. to craft legislation carrying out Mr. Trump’s domestic agenda and move it through Congress over unified Democratic opposition. A defeat or failure to move it would imperil his priorities, sending Republicans back to the drawing board to come up with an entirely new plan. But even after Mr. Trump met for roughly two hours on Tuesday afternoon with a group of conservative hard-liners who have refused to back the resolution, it was not clear whether he had persuaded enough of them to guarantee passage, given the party’s slim majority. At the meeting, the president “expressed his commitment to making sure we get the job done, that we find real savings to change the debt trajectory for the country, but also protect the essential programs,” Speaker Mike Johnson said. Mr. Johnson has leaned heavily on Mr. Trump in recent months to persuade G.O.P. skeptics to fall in line on key votes. Even the staunchest holdouts have shown the president extraordinary deference, giving in at critical moments. The president stepped up his calls for the holdouts to fall in line at an event Tuesday night for the National Republican Congressional Committee. “Stop showboating,” Mr. Trump said, adding that conservative hard-liners hoping for a better deal would “end up getting nothing — you end up getting a Democrat bill or worse.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The feud between two of President Trump’s top advisers is playing out as the administration’s new tariffs have caused huge losses across global financial markets.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The feud between two of President Trump’s top advisers is playing out as the administration’s new tariffs have caused huge losses across global financial markets. By Tyler Pager Reporting from Washington Elon Musk slammed President Trump’s top trade adviser as “dumber than a sack of bricks” on Tuesday, exposing a remarkable rift in the president’s inner circle over the wide-ranging tariffs that have upended the global economy. The feud between Mr. Musk and Peter Navarro, who has been the architect of many of Mr. Trump’s trade plans, has been simmering for days as the administration’s new tariffs have caused huge losses across global financial markets. So far, Mr. Trump has not weighed in on the clash between his top aides, both of whom he claims to hold in high regard. But Mr. Musk’s words — though aimed at Mr. Navarro — were a rare criticism of Mr. Trump’s policies from one of his most influential advisers. Mr. Musk, the world’s richest man, is estimated to have lost roughly $31 billion since Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on foreign countries on April 2, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The squabble escalated on Monday when Mr. Navarro said on CNBC that Mr. Musk was not a “car manufacturer” but a “car assembler” because Tesla, Mr. Musk’s electric vehicle company, relied on parts from around the world. Mr. Musk fired back on Tuesday, calling Mr. Navarro a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks” in a post on X, the social media site he owns. Later in the day, Mr. Musk doubled down, posting that he wanted to “apologize to bricks.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"A federal judge in California had ordered the Trump administration to rehire government employees fired as part of its efforts to slash the federal work force.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Federal Layoffs Advertisement Supported by A federal judge in California had ordered the Trump administration to rehire government employees fired as part of its efforts to slash the federal work force. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked a ruling from a federal judge in California that had ordered the Trump administration to rehire thousands of fired federal workers who had been on probationary status. The court’s brief order said the nonprofit groups that had sued to challenge the dismissals had not suffered the sort of injury that gave them standing to sue. The practical consequences of the ruling may be limited, as another trial judge’s ruling requiring the reinstatement of many of the same workers remains in place. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, but she gave no reasons. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the court should not have ruled on such an important issue in the context of an emergency application. The order was the latest administration victory in the Supreme Court in a case arising from President Trump’s recent blitz of executive orders. Like others, though, it was technical and tentative. The justices said their order would remain in place while the case moved forward. The case concerned a preliminary injunction issued last month by a federal judge in California that ordered the administration to reinstate more than 16,000 probationary employees it had fired from the Pentagon, the Treasury, and the Agriculture, Energy, Veterans Affairs and Interior Departments.

Roske, 29, of California, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. He was arrested near the justice’s home in 2022, with a pistol, a knife and other weapons. By Michael Levenson A California man pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a charge that he tried to assassinate Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in June 2022, when he was arrested near the justice’s home in Maryland with a pistol, a knife and other weapons. The man, Nicholas J. Roske, had told the police he was upset about the deadly 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and believed that Justice Kavanaugh would loosen gun control laws, prosecutors said. He also told the police that he was upset about a leaked draft of a Supreme Court opinion that revealed that the justices were poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that guaranteed the right to an abortion. Mr. Roske was arrested on June 8, 2022, after he traveled from California to Justice Kavanaugh’s home in Montgomery County, Md., with a Glock pistol, two magazines of ammunition, a knife, pepper spray, zip ties and other gear, prosecutors said. Mr. Roske called 911 after he arrived at the house in a taxi about 1 a.m. and saw two deputy U.S. marshals who were guarding the residence get out of their vehicles. Mr. Roske told the police that he was having suicidal and homicidal thoughts, that he had a gun in his suitcase and that he had come from California to kill Justice Kavanaugh, prosecutors said in court documents. On Tuesday, Mr. Roske, 29, of Simi Valley, Calif., pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Md., to a charge of attempting to assassinate a Supreme Court justice. He faces a maximum penalty of life in prison at his sentencing on Oct. 3, his lawyer said. “Nicholas Roske appeared in court today and accepted full responsibility for his conduct by pleading guilty,” the lawyer, Andrew Szekely, said in a statement. “Mr. Roske’s accountability began on June 8, 2022, when, in the throes of a mental health crisis, he called 911, told police where he was and what he was doing and asked for help. After his call, Mr. Roske cooperated with the authorities to ensure he was safely taken into custody.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"An estimated 3,500 barrels of oil spilled in a field near Fort Ransom, N.D., and the release was contained, the pipeline’s operator said.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by An estimated 3,500 barrels of oil spilled in a field near Fort Ransom, N.D., and the release was contained, the pipeline’s operator said. By Amanda Holpuch The Keystone pipeline system, which carries crude oil from Canada to the United States, was shut down on Tuesday because of a leak that spilled an estimated 3,500 barrels of oil in southeastern North Dakota, government and company officials said. The pipeline ruptured north of Fort Ransom, N.D., said Bill Suess, manager of the spill investigation program at the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality, a state agency. The cause of the spill in that city, about 78 miles southwest of Fargo, was not known, he said, and the authorities had also not said when the pipeline could be back in operation. Mr. Suess said a pipeline employee who was working on a pump station heard a “mechanical bang,” then reported the spill at 7:44 a.m. The pipeline was shut down in about two minutes, he said. “As of right now, the spill is confined to an agricultural field south of the pump station,” Mr. Suess said. He said a nearby stream had been isolated as a precaution, but it had not been affected. The pipeline system stretches 2,687 miles. In 2024, it carried about 626,000 barrels of crude oil per day, according to South Bow, the infrastructure company that operates the pipeline. It was previously operated by TC Energy, the company behind the Keystone XL pipeline project, which planned on expanding the pipeline system but was opposed by environmentalists and Indigenous groups. The Keystone XL project was terminated by the company in 2021. South Bow was spun off from TC Energy in October 2024. Solomiya Lyaskovska, a spokeswoman for South Bow, said it had sent people and equipment to the rupture site. Ms. Lyaskovska said in an email that the shutdown came “after control center leak detection systems detected a pressure drop in the system.” “The affected segment has been isolated, and operations and containment resources have been mobilized to site,” she said. “Our primary focus right now is the safety of on-site personnel and mitigating risk to the environment.” The company said in an update on Tuesday night that an estimated 3,500 barrels of oil had spilled and that the release had been contained. In December 2022, more than 500,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from the pipeline in Washington County, Kan. The pipeline’s operator at the time, TC Energy, said in February 2023 that the spill was caused by “bending stress” on the pipe and a “weld flaw.” In October 2019, the pipeline leaked about 383,000 gallons of crude oil in Edinburg, N.D., about 155 miles north of Fort Ransom. State environmental regulators said that the spill covered an estimated half-acre of wetland. Amanda Holpuch covers breaking news and other topics.

By Jack HealyAlexandra BerzonTara Siegel Bernard and Nicholas Nehamas Jack Healy reported from Glendale, Ariz.; Alexandra Berzon from Los Angeles; Tara Siegel Bernard from New York; and Nicholas Nehamas from Washington, D.C. The line started forming outside the Social Security office in suburban Glendale, Ariz., not long after sunrise, dozens of retirees and people with disabilities, shuffling papers, some leaning on walkers, all anxious to know whether President Trump’s government overhaul had put their safety nets at risk. When 9 a.m. came, an employee emerged from the building with fliers asking the crowd to come back — once they had scheduled an appointment. “I’ve called for days!” one woman yelled. “We came from a long ways away,” said another. Still another let everyone know they had been handed a load of bunk, though she used a more colorful term. With the stock market in turmoil and the economy under threat, beneficiaries might see their monthly Social Security checks as predictable amid the chaos rippling out of Washington. After all, Mr. Trump has promised not to cut Social Security benefits for the 73 million Americans enrolled. But that promise has not insulated the Depression-era program once deemed the third rail of American politics. Thousands of worried and frustrated recipients have thronged local field offices, asking why the phone lines are jammed, whether their local offices will be closed by Elon Musk’s team of software engineers and technology executives and whether they will lose their benefits. Waves of buyouts and early retirements have hobbled the staff at many local offices, and recipients say it has become harder to use the agency’s website and phone systems, or even be seen in person.

"The Trump administration is dialing back its enforcement of cryptocurrency, and criticizing Biden-era prosecutions.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Trump administration is dialing back its enforcement of cryptocurrency, and criticizing Biden-era prosecutions. By Devlin Barrett Reporting from Washington The Trump administration is disbanding a unit in the Justice Department that was responsible for investigating cryptocurrency crimes, criticizing the Biden administration as too aggressive against the fast-growing industry. In a memo issued late Monday, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, denounced his predecessors for investigating cryptocurrency operators in a manner he called “ill conceived and poorly executed.” He instead instructed the department to narrow the focus of cryptocurrency investigations to crimes like fraud, drug trafficking and terrorism. The directive is in keeping with President Trump’s broad embrace of the crypto industry during his campaign and in office as he moves to relax enforcement. The Trump family has expanded its business interests in the industry, including by establishing a crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. Shortly before taking office, Mr. Trump issued his own memecoin. And Trump Media & Technology Group, the social media company he is the majority shareholder in, has said it plans to introduce a number of digital asset investment products this year. The Justice Department directive follows similar moves at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has dismissed lawsuits and pending investigations involving matters in which crypto firms had not registered as exchanges. A number of S.E.C. lawyers on those cases have left the regulatory agency. The S.E.C. has also drastically cut staffing of a crypto enforcement unit. As a matter of policy, the S.E.C. has said it is not going to seek to regulate memecoins because the novelty digital assets are not securities. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The director of national intelligence framed it as an effort to eliminate the politicization of the agencies and to investigate episodes where intelligence was “weaponized.”",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The director of national intelligence framed it as an effort to eliminate the politicization of the agencies and to investigate episodes where intelligence was “weaponized.” By Julian E. Barnes Julian E. Barnes reports on U.S. intelligence agencies and international security. Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, announced Tuesday a new task force that would work on declassifying information in the public interest and improving efficiency inside the intelligence agencies. Ms. Gabbard framed the work of the new task force, the Director’s Initiative Group, as an effort to eliminate the politicization of the agencies and to investigate episodes where intelligence was “weaponized” against people. Some of the examples Ms. Gabbard’s office highlights as efforts to remove politics from the intelligence agencies have been seen by Democrats and Biden administration officials as political themselves, such as stripping security clearances from senior Democrats and opponents of President Trump. But in a statement, Ms. Gabbard said the new push would restore trust in intelligence agencies. “We are committed to executing the president’s vision and focusing the intelligence community on its core mission: ensuring our security by providing the president and policymakers with timely, apolitical, objective, relevant intelligence to inform their decision-making to ensure the safety, security and freedom of the American people,” Ms. Gabbard said. Ms. Gabbard’s office did not name the members of the initiative group. The group will review documents for potential declassification and release on a range of topics including the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, the intelligence community’s investigations of the health incidents linked to Havana syndrome and the investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election. The group may also advise on the release of documents on the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, which President Trump ordered released. Ms. Gabbard also said she would have the group assess whether information about the Biden administration’s alleged surveillance or censorship of Americans should be released. While her office provided few details, the Trump administration has criticized the Biden administration’s work against domestic terrorism and countering disinformation, arguing such efforts curbed the rights of Mr. Trump’s supporters. The group will also make recommendations to end wasteful spending by the intelligence agencies and to cut bureaucracy. Senior administration officials have suggested that cumbersome structures inside some spy agencies have slowed the flow of intelligence to the President’s Daily Brief and other important intelligence documents.

By Zach Montague Reporting from Washington A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the White House to restore The Associated Press’s full access to President Trump, finding that the effort to ban the outlet over objections to its coverage violated the First Amendment. The order dealt a blow to Mr. Trump, who, in a departure from decades of tradition, has moved to leverage access to presidential events as a way of asserting more direct control over how news organizations cover his administration. Trump officials began barring the outlet from physically covering events with the president in February, citing the wire service’s refusal to adopt the administration’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The outlet sued, with the dispute raising profound questions about the independent news media’s role in covering presidential administrations and the lasting implications of Mr. Trump’s efforts to refigure the White House press corps. In a sharply worded opinion, Judge Trevor N. McFadden of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia wrote that the Trump administration must “immediately rescind their viewpoint-based denial” of The Associated Press from presidential events. “The government repeatedly characterizes The A.P.’s request as a demand for ‘extra special access.’ But that is not what The A.P. is asking for, and it is not what the court orders,” he wrote. “All The A.P. wants, and all it gets, is a level playing field.” Moments after issuing the opinion, Judge McFadden paused his own order from taking effect until Sunday, giving the government five days to file an emergency appeal. The injunction he ordered would stay in place until the case is over, or a higher court intervenes. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"American military officials say the Pentagon might need to dip into stockpiles in Asia to replenish supplies in the Middle East, congressional aides say.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Middle East Tensions Advertisement Supported by American military officials say the Pentagon might need to dip into stockpiles in Asia to replenish supplies in the Middle East, congressional aides say. By Edward Wong and Eric Schmitt Reporting from Washington U.S. commanders planning for a possible conflict with China are increasingly concerned that the Pentagon will soon need to move long-range precision weapons from stockpiles in the Asia-Pacific region to the Middle East, congressional officials say. That is because of the large amount of munitions that the United States is using in a bombing campaign in Yemen ordered by President Trump. U.S. readiness in the Pacific is also being hurt by the Pentagon’s deployment of warships and aircraft to the Middle East after the Israel-Gaza war began in October 2023 and after Houthi militia forces in Yemen started attacking ships in the Red Sea to support the Palestinians, the officials say. The American ships and aircraft, as well as the service members working on them, are being pushed at what the military calls a high operating tempo. Even basic equipment maintenance becomes an issue under those grinding conditions. The congressional officials who spoke about the problems did so on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about sensitive military matters. Adm. Samuel Paparo, the head of the Pentagon’s Indo-Pacific Command since May, will almost certainly be asked about readiness issues when he is expected to testify before Congress on Wednesday and Thursday.

"An advisory says that foreign agencies are posing as consulting firms, think tanks and other organizations to connect with former government employees.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by An advisory says that foreign agencies are posing as consulting firms, think tanks and other organizations to connect with former government employees. By Julian E. Barnes Reporting from Washington The National Counterintelligence and Security Center warned on Tuesday that China’s intelligence services were using deceptive efforts to recruit current and former U.S. government employees. The center, along with the F.B.I. and the Pentagon’s counterintelligence service, said in an advisory that foreign intelligence agencies were posing as consulting firms, corporate think tanks and other organizations to recruit former U.S. officials. The American government has long said that China uses social networks to secretly recruit people. But former U.S. officials say China now sees an opportunity as the Trump administration shuts down agencies, fires probationary employees and pushes out people who had worked on diversity issues. The warning advised former officials who have security clearances of their “legal obligation to protect classified data” even after they leave the government. It added that China and other foreign countries were targeting a variety of former officials. Postings on the social media platform Bluesky targeted researchers dismissed by the National Institutes of Health, offering them a chance to “pursue career development” in Shenzhen, China. Former officials said other outreach from foreign intelligence services has targeted agents let go from the F.B.I. and military officers who have retired. “Current and former federal employees should beware of these virtual approaches and understand the potential consequences of engaging,” the counterintelligence center said. Chinese intelligence services often begin recruitment efforts by offering a small fee for an innocuous research paper. Over time, the requests push for more sensitive material. The center advised former officials, particularly people with security clearances, to be careful about what they post concerning their government work. Red flags of the recruiting efforts include offers of disproportionately high salaries and flexible work conditions, the center said. Recruiters can also be “overly responsive” to messages from a former government official and give a strange amount of praise. Last month, CNN reported that China and Russia had directed their intelligence services to ramp up recruiting of U.S. federal employees working on national security issues, including targeting people who could be fired. Former officials have said that workers forced out of government jobs can be vulnerable — desperate for work and angry at the government — and could let down their guard. While some approaches, like the ones posted on Bluesky, were obviously of Chinese origin, others may be better disguised, appearing to come from American companies, former officials said. While intelligence and military officials are trained to recognize such efforts by foreign intelligence services, government researchers do not routinely receive the same level of counterintelligence training. The intelligence agencies have not cut as deeply as some departments, like the U.S. Agency for International Development, but the C.I.A. has fired about 80 probationary employees. The National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies have also fired workers. Julian E. Barnes covers the U.S. intelligence agencies and international security matters for The Times. He has written about security issues for more than two decades.

"The funding pause amid civil rights investigations into both universities sharply escalates the Trump administration’s campaign against elite colleges.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by The funding pause amid civil rights investigations into both universities sharply escalates the Trump administration’s campaign against elite colleges. By Michael C. Bender and Sheryl Gay Stolberg Reporting from Washington The Trump administration has frozen more than $1 billion in funding for Cornell and $790 million for Northwestern amid civil rights investigations into both schools, two U.S. officials said. The funding pause involves mostly grants from and contracts with the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Education and Health and Human Services, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the unannounced decision. The moves are the latest and largest in a rapidly escalating campaign against elite American universities that has resulted in billions in federal funds being suspended or put under review in just over a month. Other schools that have had funds threatened include Brown, Columbia, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton. Cornell and Northwestern are both facing investigations into allegations of antisemitism and into accusations of racial discrimination stemming from their efforts to promote diversity. Cornell officials said in a statement that they had received more than 75 stop-work orders from the Defense Department on Tuesday, but that they had no information to confirm that more than $1 billion in funding had been suspended. The affected grants, they said, supported research that they described as “profoundly significant to American defense, cybersecurity and health.” “We are actively seeking information from federal officials to learn more about the basis for these decisions,” said the joint statement from Michael Kotlikoff, the university president; Kavita Bala, the provost; and Robert Harrington, provost for medical affairs.

"Tourists are required to stay on marked paths in thermal areas because of the dangers of the hot springs, geysers and steam vents, and to protect nature.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Tourists are required to stay on marked paths in thermal areas because of the dangers of the hot springs, geysers and steam vents, and to protect nature. By Adeel Hassan Three visitors to Yellowstone National Park were sentenced last month to short jail terms for unrelated misdemeanor violations, federal prosecutors said, emphasizing the need for safety on protected parkland. Two visitors who strayed from clearly marked paths or roads in thermal areas at the park were each sentenced to seven days in jail, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Wyoming said late last month. A third visitor was sentenced to 10 days for driving under the influence of alcohol in the park, the office said. The three were sentenced for public land violations that happened last fall, and their terms were handed down just weeks before the peak tourist season begins at Yellowstone, most of which is in Wyoming. “The No. 1 priority is public safety, but natural resources are also important in places like Yellowstone National Park,” Lori Hogan, a public affairs officer with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Wyoming, said in an interview on Tuesday. “More dangerous offenses, like thermal trespass or wildlife disturbance, could potentially lead to jail time, while minor violations might result in fines or warnings,” she said. “The public should understand the violations and their consequences before visiting.” Walking on the thermal grounds at Yellowstone can be extremely dangerous, park officials said, because the ground is fragile and thin, and scalding water just below the surface can cause severe or fatal burns.

Four suspects were in custody, the authorities said.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Three others were injured in the shooting on a suburban street in Spotsylvania County, southwest of Washington, D.C. Four suspects were in custody, the authorities said. By Hank SandersAlexandra E. Petri and Jonathan Wolfe Three people were killed and three others were wounded in a shooting on a residential street just outside Fredericksburg, Va., on Tuesday, the Spotsylvania County Sheriff’s Office said. The sheriff’s office said in a statement that it had arrested and charged four people, ages 16 to 18, early Wednesday in connection with the shooting. Officials said they believed the shooting was linked to an illegal gun sale and robbery. “All suspects” were in custody and there was “no threat to public safety,” the sheriff’s office said on social media. The shooting was reported around 5:30 p.m. on Olde Greenwich Circle, a street of modest townhouses in Spotsylvania County about 60 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., the sheriff’s office said. The sheriff’s office said that the victims included Chase Feaster and Alonzo Goffney, both 18. It did not name the third victim, a 20-year-old man, because his identity was still being confirmed by the medical examiner’s office. The injured were taken to area hospitals, the sheriff’s office said on Tuesday. It named one of the suspects, Jeremiah Upson, 18. The office did not disclose the names of the others, but said they included two 16-year-olds and a 17-year-old. The four were charged with malicious wounding, use of a firearm in committing a felony and unlawful assembly, according to the statement. One 16-year-old suspect was in the hospital with a gunshot wound; the other three were being held without bond. Fredericksburg City Public Schools delayed the start of classes by two hours on Wednesday, citing “the profound impact this incident has had on members of our school community.” Reports of the shooting drew a heavy police response. A video posted on social media showed officers marching through a wooded area with their guns drawn. Andrea Staples, a receptionist at Strictly Ballroom, a dance studio in a shopping plaza near Olde Greenwich Circle, said a student had called at around 6:30 p.m. after leaving class to alert them to the shooting and the shelter-in-place advisory. “I locked the door and went and checked the back,” Ms. Staples said. A class was in session at the time, she said, and the students sheltered in place until about 8 p.m. Hank Sanders is a Times reporter and a member of the 2024-25 Times Fellowship class, a program for journalists early in their careers.

"The announcement by Mr. Paxton, the attorney general of Texas and a firebrand conservative, set up what is expected to be a blockbuster showdown in Texas.",2025-04-08,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The announcement by Mr. Paxton, the attorney general of Texas and a firebrand conservative, set up what is expected to be a blockbuster showdown in Texas. By J. David Goodman Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, officially announced on Tuesday that he was challenging Senator John Cornyn in the Republican primary next year, setting up what is likely to be the most contentious and expensive intraparty contest of 2026. Mr. Paxton, a firebrand conservative litigant who has sought to strongly align himself with President Trump, had been teasing a run against Mr. Cornyn for weeks. He all but announced his intentions in an interview with The New York Times last week. On Tuesday, Mr. Paxton unveiled a website for his nascent campaign, prominently featuring a photo of him posing with Mr. Trump, and he officially announced his run in an interview on Fox News. “It’s definitely time for a change in Texas,” Mr. Paxton said on the program “The Ingraham Angle.” In a post on social media, he promised to “fight for President Trump’s agenda and take a sledgehammer to the D.C. establishment.” Mr. Paxton has tried to position himself as the preferred candidate of the Republican primary base in Texas, a conservative electorate that has appeared receptive to his campaign in recent polling. Mr. Cornyn, realizing the looming challenge, announced his own campaign last month in a video that heavily featured his own connections to Mr. Trump. In recent days he rolled out an endorsement from the union for U.S. Border Patrol agents, an important show of support for conservative voters who list border security among their top issues. In response to Mr. Paxton’s announcement, the Cornyn campaign pointed to the senator’s voting record, which it said aligned with President Trump more than nearly every other senator. The campaign referred to Mr. Paxton as “a fraud.” “This will be a spirited campaign and we assure Texans they will have a real choice when this race is over,” the campaign said in a statement on Tuesday. Republican voters in Texas are well familiar with both Mr. Cornyn, who has been in state politics for four decades, and Mr. Paxton, a former state representative and state senator now in his third term as attorney general. Mr. Paxton survived an impeachment trial in 2023, initiated by Texas House Republicans, over allegations of corruption and abuse of office that were lodged against him by some of his former top aides. Those aides also filed a whistle-blower suit against him over their firings. Late last week a judge sided with them, saying that Mr. Paxton had admitted to the allegations and that the state should pay $6.6 million to settle the claims. Mr. Paxton has vowed to appeal. J.

"Nuclear talks between the United States and Iran are set for Saturday. President Trump has set a high bar for success.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Middle East Tensions Advertisement Supported by Nuclear talks between the United States and Iran are set for Saturday. President Trump has set a high bar for success. By Luke Broadwater and David E. Sanger Luke Broadwater covers the White House and David E. Sanger has reported on the Iranian nuclear program for two decades. They reported from Washington. In 2016, running for president and pressed for details on how he would handle some of the world’s knottiest security issues, then-candidate Donald J. Trump had a simple formula for defanging the Iranian nuclear program. Barack Obama’s negotiating team, he said, should have just gotten up from the table and stormed out. The Iranians would have come begging. “It’s a deal that could’ve been so much better just if they’d walked a couple of times,” Mr. Trump told two reporters from The New York Times. “They negotiated so badly.” Now, at a moment the Iranians are far closer to being able to produce a weapon than they were when the last accord was negotiated — in part because Mr. Trump himself upended the deal in 2018 — the president has his chance to show how it should have been done. So far, the gap between the two sides appears huge. The Iranians sound like they are looking for an updated version of the Obama-era agreement, which limited Iran’s stockpiles of nuclear material. The Americans want to dismantle a vast nuclear-fuel enrichment infrastructure, the country’s missile program and Tehran’s longtime support for Hamas, Hezbollah and other proxy forces. What is missing is time. “It is essential that we reach an agreement quickly,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, who called Mr. Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal a “serious mistake.” “Iran’s nuclear program is advancing every day, and with snapback sanctions set to expire soon, we are at risk of losing one of our most critical points of leverage.” Snapback sanctions allow for the quick reimposition of United Nations sanctions against Iran.

"Once thought of as a fringe mind-set, the prepared citizen movement is gaining traction in a world shaped by war, the pandemic and extreme weather.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Once thought of as a fringe mind-set, the prepared citizen movement is gaining traction in a world shaped by war, the pandemic and extreme weather. By Thomas Gibbons-Neff Thomas Gibbons-Neff reported from Leesburg and Orlando, Fla., and participated in the minuteman training described in the article. The New York Times paid to take the class. Ten men, some wearing camouflage, others in vests loaded with ammunition for their AR-15 rifles, gathered under the morning shade of oak trees in Central Florida last month. They were there to learn marksmanship tactics common among Special Operation forces and elite law enforcement units. Their instructor, Christopher Eric Roscher, an Air Force veteran, introduced himself and then led the group in prayer. “Lord, you would use them as assets, to be protectors in this world, in a world that’s full of evil,” he prayed. The men gathered around him were not soldiers, police officers or right-wing militia members. They were mostly civilians, including two pilots, a nurse and a construction company executive. The class’s title — Full Contender Minuteman — even referred to the civilians turned soldiers of the American Revolution. In a world shaped by war, a pandemic and extreme weather, more Americans are getting ready for crisis — whether it’s to fight a tyrannical government, repel an invading army or respond to a natural disaster. They are known as prepared or professional citizens, part of a growing number of gun owners who are adapting their mind-set to uncertain and polarized times. And rather than being part of more fringe “prepper” culture, they are growing more mainstream, catered to by companies ready to offer them the tools and training to be ready.

But he has the support of some of President Trump’s most influential allies. Dale Wagner, sheriff of Adams County, Wash.Credit... Supported by By Jazmine Ulloa Photographs by Jordan Gale Reporting from Seattle and Othello, Wa. In his pocket of eastern Washington, where sweet corn and potato fields stretch for miles, Sheriff Dale Wagner of Adams County talks about immigration enforcement in solemn terms like oath and duty. But precisely whom Sheriff Wagner has a duty to serve and obey is a question that has put him at odds with the state’s top law enforcement official and thrust the two of them into an escalating debate over what role local and state authorities should play in helping enforce immigration law. Nick Brown, Washington’s attorney general, has accused Sheriff Wagner in a lawsuit of sharing inmate information with federal immigration agents in defiance of a state law meant to limit collaboration between Washington’s law enforcement officers and federal immigration agencies. In an interview in his office in the city of Othello, Sheriff Wagner defended providing inmate information to federal agents, saying he was within his authority and that he was doing what he needed to do to protect his constituents. “It goes back to my oath,” he said. “I protect the State of Washington’s Constitution as best I can, and the United States Constitution as best I can, and that’s all I can do.” The lawsuit also alleges that deputies in his office have been holding people in jail based solely on immigration status, and that deputies have been allowing such prisoners to be interrogated by federal agents — allegations that Sheriff Wagner said were untrue.

For “Bone Valley,” a podcast about the case, he connected with the man who said he did it. By Remy Tumin Even as he was serving 36 years of a life sentence for killing his wife, Leo Schofield put in the work to forgive the man who confessed to the crime. He turned to his faith. He mentored younger inmates. He became someone who mattered to others on the inside. But it wasn’t until recently — nearly a year since he had been paroled after decades of maintaining he was innocent — that Mr. Schofield was able to feel a “sense of completion,” after he and Jeremy Scott spoke on the phone for the first time. “Forgiveness is not about the person who hurt us,” Mr. Schofield said in a recent interview. “It’s about us who are hurt and being freed from the effect of that.” “Jeremy and I had a chance to close a chapter,” he added. Their conversation is featured in the second season of “Bone Valley,” the podcast whose initial series of episodes in 2023 chronicled Mr. Schofield’s efforts to prove his innocence as producers described a case riddled with errors. The second season, the first two episodes of which will be available starting Wednesday, explores Mr. Scott’s confession to killing Michelle Schofield in 1987 and his reconciliation with his son after years of estrangement. Mr. Scott also details another murder he says he committed but for which he was never charged. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

An autistic young man loses his caretaker as the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown expands to permanent U.S. residents convicted of minor crimes years ago. John and Lena Ferris with their son Luke, center, in Falls Church, Va.Credit... Supported by By Miriam Jordan Photographs by Caroline Gutman Alfredo Orellana, 31, was not just a caregiver for Luke Ferris, a 28-year-old with severe autism. The pair worked out at the gym, got tacos and played video games together. They exchanged elbow bumps. “It’s like Luke got a bro to hang out with,” said Mr. Ferris’s mother, Lena, from their home in Falls Church, Va. Then suddenly, after four years, Mr. Orellana, who goes by Alex, was gone, locked up in an immigration detention center nearly 2,000 miles away. A permanent U.S. resident, or green card holder, Mr. Orellana is facing deportation for trying to swindle a store out of $200 eight years ago when, his wife said, he was struggling with substance abuse. The detention of Mr. Orellana and other green card holders is the latest sign that the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration is expanding far beyond people who are in the country illegally. Tasked with fulfilling President Trump’s campaign promise to carry out mass deportations, federal agents have been detaining permanent U.S. residents convicted of years-old minor offenses and moving to deport them. Their families are reeling, as are some of the people they work for, like the Ferrises, who had come to rely on, and even cherish, Mr. Orellana’s care for Luke.

"As Willkie Farr & Gallagher learned, cutting a deal with the White House can avert a financially punitive executive order. But doing so can draw internal rebukes and external criticism.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by As Willkie Farr & Gallagher learned, cutting a deal with the White House can avert a financially punitive executive order. But doing so can draw internal rebukes and external criticism. By Ben ProtessMaggie Haberman and Michael S. Schmidt Willkie Farr & Gallagher last week became the latest law firm to strike a deal with the White House and escape President Trump’s wrath. But the firm, which pledged $100 million in legal services to causes that the Trump administration supports, traded one problem for another. Willkie has faced a backlash to the deal in recent days, including within its ranks, as concerns mount over Mr. Trump’s broader law firm crackdown. Doug Emhoff, former Vice President Kamala Harris’s husband and one of Willkie’s most prominent partners, publicly assailed the agreement with Mr. Trump. Congressional Democrats are now demanding information about the deal. And Willkie’s longest-serving lawyer, Joseph T. Baio, resigned rather than stay at a firm that gave in to the White House’s demands. In an email to the firm’s executive committee, Mr. Baio wrote that he had left so he could “join the fight against governmental tyranny, unconstitutional decrees and social injustice, particularly at this critical time.” The fallout at Willkie, which counted Mr. Trump among its clients decades ago, illustrates the no-win predicament facing law firms caught in Mr. Trump’s cross hairs. If they resist, the firms jeopardize their bottom line, exposing themselves to executive orders that, while legally dubious, imperil their businesses. But if they buckle, they are seen by critics as having compromised their integrity, drawing rebukes from across the broader legal community. “We know this news is not welcomed by some of you, and you would have urged a different course of action,” Willkie’s executive committee said in an email to the firm last week explaining the deal. “Needless to say, this was an incredibly difficult decision for firm leadership.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Hard-line conservatives concerned about the deficit are among President Trump’s most stalwart supporters in Congress. But they say they cannot in good conscience back the budget plan he has endorsed.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Hard-line conservatives concerned about the deficit are among President Trump’s most stalwart supporters in Congress. But they say they cannot in good conscience back the budget plan he has endorsed. By Catie Edmondson Reporting from the Capitol Representative Eric Burlison, a two-term congressman from Missouri’s Ozarks, is unequivocal about his support for President Trump. “I love the president,” he said this week as he walked through the Capitol. But Mr. Burlison is also one of about a dozen hard-line conservative Republicans who have said they cannot back their party’s budget blueprint to unlock Mr. Trump’s spending and tax cuts, even as the president is imploring them to support it in a vote that could come as early as Wednesday. “I can’t live with myself if I go back home and I added more debt and deficits without any kind of correction whatsoever,” said Mr. Burlison, a financial analyst who campaigned on bringing down the debt. “I couldn’t live with myself.” A former state lawmaker, he successfully pushed for the Missouri Legislature to seek an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to require a balanced budget. The unusual burst of resistance that emerged on Capitol Hill came from lawmakers who typically count themselves among Mr. Trump’s closest allies. G.O.P. lawmakers have long shown Mr. Trump extraordinary deference, and at the outset of his second term have caved to him on critical votes after getting a personal call or finding themselves on the receiving end of a blistering social media post. They still may relent. After Mr. Trump met with a group of House Republicans on Tuesday, a handful of holdouts dropped their opposition to the resolution. But their insistence that they would not support a measure without the promise of deeper spending cuts underscored the challenge for G.O.P. leaders toiling to manage a group in their ranks who view reducing the debt as their north star.

"The U.S. State Department said it was alarmed at the arrest of Paul Chambers, a lecturer in civil-military relations, under Thailand’s strict lèse-majesté laws.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The U.S. State Department said it was alarmed at the arrest of Paul Chambers, a lecturer in civil-military relations, under Thailand’s strict lèse-majesté laws. By Isabella Kwai The arrest of an American academic in Thailand on charges of criticizing the monarchy has alarmed U.S. officials, the State Department said on Tuesday. The case represents a rare detention of a foreign citizen under Thailand’s strict lèse-majesté laws. The academic, Paul Chambers, a lecturer in civil-military relations in Southeast Asia at Naresuan University in northern Thailand, was arrested on charges under the lèse-majesté laws and the Computer Crimes Act, according to his lawyers, members of the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, a legal aid group. Immigration authorities also revoked his visa, the group said on Wednesday, suggesting that he could be forced to leave the country. The charges stem from a brief online description of a webinar last October about Thailand’s military and police forces where Dr. Chambers was the featured speaker, his legal team said. The text, which appeared on the website of a research institute in Singapore and has since been edited, described Thailand’s king as having authority over changes to the military leadership, according to the lawyers. They said that Dr. Chambers had not written the text. Days after the webinar, a unit of the Royal Thai Armed Forces responsible for internal security requested more information from Naresuan University about the webinar and Dr. Chambers, his lawyers said. A provincial court issued an arrest warrant for Dr. Chambers on March 31, his lawyers said, and he voluntarily reported to the police station in Phitsanulok, in northern Thailand, on Friday morning. A police officer at the station informed him that he had been accused of publicizing the webinar invitation, his lawyers said. The statement that the king had power over military reshuffles was false and insulting to the monarch, the officer said. Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate, a representative for Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, said that Dr. Chambers denied the charges. “He clearly cannot be posting anything he wants on the website,” he said.

"The decisions suggest that the battle over using a wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to deport migrants is certain to persist.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The decisions suggest that the battle over using a wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to deport migrants is certain to persist. By Alan Feuer and Jonah E. Bromwich Two federal judges issued separate orders on Wednesday placing road blocks in the Trump administration’s continuing efforts to use a powerful wartime statute to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members to El Salvador. The twin rulings, in New York and Texas, were in direct response to a Supreme Court decision handed down on Monday that overturned a similar order issued last month by a federal judge in Washington. They suggest that even though President Trump declared victory when the justices weighed in on the matter, the battle over using the wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act, to deport migrants is certain to persist. In its decision, the Supreme Court found that migrants subject to deportation under the act need to be given notice before being removed from the country so that they can challenge the process in court. But those challenges, the justices said, are required to be made in the places where the migrants are being held. On Tuesday, two Venezuelans being held in a detention center in the town of Goshen, in Orange County, N.Y., asked Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein to shield them from being deported. Judge Hellerstein, at a hearing on Wednesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, issued a narrow decision in their case. He said that any Venezuelan migrants in his judicial district, the Southern District of New York, subject to deportation under the statute have to be given the opportunity to have a hearing before they are removed from the country. “It seems to me that people need to be protected,” Judge Hellerstein said. In a broader decision handed down in Federal District Court in Brownsville, Texas, Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. said that the administration cannot use the Alien Enemies Act to remove any Venezuelans being held at the El Valle Detention Center, in Raymondville, near the southern border, until at least April 23.

"Elon Musk’s team is leading an effort to link government databases, to the alarm of privacy and security experts.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Elon Musk’s team is leading an effort to link government databases, to the alarm of privacy and security experts. By Emily Badger and Sheera Frenkel The federal government knows your mother’s maiden name and your bank account number. The student debt you hold. Your disability status. The company that employs you and the wages you earn there. And that’s just a start. Source: Agency documents assembled by The New York Times These intimate details about the personal lives of people who live in the United States are held in disconnected data systems across the federal government — some at the Treasury, some at the Social Security Administration and some at the Department of Education, among other agencies. The Trump administration is now trying to connect the dots of that disparate information. Last month, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the “consolidation” of these segregated records, raising the prospect of creating a kind of data trove about Americans that the government has never had before, and that members of the president’s own party have historically opposed. The effort is being driven by Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, and his lieutenants with the Department of Government Efficiency, who have sought access to dozens of databases as they have swept through agencies across the federal government. Along the way, they have elbowed past the objections of career staff, data security protocols, national security experts and legal privacy protections. So far, the Musk group’s success has varied by agency and sometimes by the day, as differing rulings have come down from federal judges hearing more than a dozen lawsuits challenging the moves. The group has been temporarily blocked from sensitive data at several agencies, including the Social Security Administration. But on Monday, an appeals court reversed a preliminary injunction barring the group’s access at the Treasury, the Department of Education and the Office of Personnel Management.

"At an event in Washington, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan struck a more measured tone on the president’s trade war than other Democrats seen as possible 2028 contenders.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by At an event in Washington, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan struck a more measured tone on the president’s trade war than other Democrats seen as possible 2028 contenders. By Reid J. Epstein Reporting from Washington Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, one of the Democratic Party’s most prominent state leaders, warned in a speech on Wednesday that President Trump’s trade war could have calamitous effects but was careful not to blame him directly as she embraced a bipartisan message. “Tariffs need to be used like a scalpel, not a hammer,” Ms. Whitmer said in Washington, at an event space near the White House. “Unfortunately, it’s unclear how this is going to strategically benefit the American economy or the American consumer. And I think that’s the big problem.” During her address and while responding to questions from Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News anchor, Ms. Whitmer sought to thread a political needle, avoiding direct criticism of Mr. Trump or his administration — a notable contrast with the blunter attacks on the president made by other Democrats seen as potential presidential contenders in 2028. She included encouraging anecdotes about a meeting she had in Michigan with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as well as Vice President JD Vance’s visit to the state, even as she cautioned that the administration’s tariff policies could cause an economic collapse. Ms. Whitmer described Mr. Trump’s approach as unstable, unpredictable and damaging to corporations that rely on economic stability and steady governance. But by day’s end, she was standing in the Oval Office while Mr. Trump — who hours earlier had announced a 90-day pause on most of his reciprocal tariffs — signed executive orders, mused again falsely about a rigged 2020 election, and praised Ms. Whitmer as “a very good person.” “We’re honored to have Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan, the great state of Michigan — she’s really done an excellent job,” Mr. Trump said as Ms. Whitmer stood across the room.

"President Trump has set his sights on defunding colleges, singling out some of the world’s wealthiest schools in what critics say is an attack on academic freedom.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by President Trump has set his sights on defunding colleges, singling out some of the world’s wealthiest schools in what critics say is an attack on academic freedom. By Alan Blinder The Trump administration is seeking to exert extraordinary influence over American universities by withholding the kind of federal financial support that has flowed to campuses for decades. President Trump and his allies contend that some schools, especially a handful of elite universities, have become bastions of antisemitism and ideological indoctrination. Though the higher education industry has acknowledged shortcomings and failures, especially since the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, it has warned that reducing schools’ federal funding could backfire on American society as a whole. University leaders fear that by threatening to withhold funding, or suspending it with little or no warning, the government is trying to stamp out academic freedom, a cornerstone of the American education system. The Trump administration has given broad reasons for the cuts, often involving claims that the schools tolerate antisemitism. But the choice of schools it has targeted and even some of its demands have sometimes confused educators and experts. Northwestern University, for example, recently released a lists of steps it had taken to combat antisemitism that closely tracked with a list of demands the Trump administration had given to Columbia University. Northwestern was targeted several days later, nonetheless. The issue is revealing the dollars-and-cents consequences of the tensions between campus leaders and the Trump administration. But the outcome of the underlying debate — over the very purpose of higher education — could shape the country for years to come. So far, seven universities have been singled out for punitive funding cuts or have been explicitly notified that their funding is in serious jeopardy. They are: Harvard University, which has approximately $9 billion at stake. The government has already canceled more than $2.2 billion in retaliation after Harvard publicly rebuffed the Trump administration’s demands. Harvard quickly sued the administration, and the case is pending. The president has also threatened Harvard’s tax-exempt status. Brown University, which the Trump administration said stood to lose $510 million. Columbia, which is hoping to regain about $400 million in canceled grants and contracts after it bowed to a list of demands from the federal government. Cornell University, the target of a cut of at least $1 billion. Northwestern, which Trump administration officials said would be stripped of $790 million. The University of Pennsylvania, which saw $175 million in federal funding suspended in response to its approach to a transgender athlete’s sports participation in 2022. Princeton University, which said “dozens” of grants had been suspended. The White House indicated that $210 million was at risk. Officials at some of the universities have been puzzled by the cuts, which they have sometimes learned about through social media, and insisted that they had taken action to combat antisemitism.

"Attorney General Pam Bondi relied on an increasingly common assertion: that the judge was “unelected” and denying the will of voters who put the president in office.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Attorney General Pam Bondi relied on an increasingly common assertion: that the judge was “unelected” and denying the will of voters who put the president in office. By Matthew Goldstein The Justice Department is once again criticizing a federal judge for taking steps to block one of the Trump administration’s policies, this time an executive order against a big law firm. Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a memo sent recently to federal agencies, said an “unelected federal judge” had overstepped his authority in temporarily blocking most of an executive order that President Trump issued last month against the firm Jenner & Block. The memo said the judge’s order had “yet again invaded the policy-making and free speech prerogatives of the executive branch.” The memo, which was co-signed by Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, was included in a status report filed on Tuesday evening in federal court. Judge John D. Bates of Federal District Court in Washington, who issued the restraining order, had asked the Justice Department to provide updates on how the administration was complying with it. The memo said that while government agencies should pay heed to the restraining order, the executive order was justified because Jenner & Block was “committed to the weaponization of justice, discrimination on the basis of race, radical gender ideology and other anti-American pursuits.” Members of the Trump administration have repeatedly criticized federal judges who have issued orders blocking a variety of government policies. A frequent line of attack is that the orders are coming from “unelected judges” who are denying the wishes of the voters who elected Mr. Trump. Earlier on Tuesday, Jenner & Block filed a motion to make Judge Bates’s temporary restraining order permanent, and WilmerHale, another law firm targeted by a Trump executive order, filed a parallel request on a separate restraining order from another federal judge, Richard J. Leon. The executive orders signed by Mr. Trump portray the law firms as national security risks and call for actions that would make it difficult or impossible them to represent companies with government contracts or in need of regulatory approvals, and would prevent lawyers from even entering federal buildings — including courthouses. The firms contend that Mr. Trump’s actions against them are unconstitutional. The Justice Department filed motions late on Tuesday to dismiss the suits brought by the two law firms challenging the executive orders. The department argued that both law firms were “muzzling” the president’s right to speak out against legal practices that he maintains are unlawful. In particular, the government’s court filings focused on the firms’ hiring practices, which the government said were unlawful because each engaged in diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Mr. Trump, upon taking office, issued broad mandates to eliminate all forms of D.E.I. hiring practices and policies in the federal government, and his appointees have rapidly worked to enact those bans. In March, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sent letters to 20 law firms requesting information about their D.E.I. practices. One of those firms was WilmerHale. Matthew Goldstein is a Times reporter who covers Wall Street and white-collar crime and housing issues.

By Catie EdmondsonMichael Gold and Maya C. Miller Reporting from the Capitol Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday was forced to delay a vote on the Republican budget blueprint to unlock President Trump’s domestic agenda, after conservatives balked at a plan that they said would add too much to the nation’s debt. In a dramatic scene on Capitol Hill that laid bare Republican divisions, Mr. Johnson huddled with the holdouts in a room off the House floor for over an hour before the vote was scheduled to begin, grinding activity in the chamber to a halt as the measure’s fate hung in the balance. It has been a tried-and-true tactic for Mr. Johnson, who has previously succeeded at wearing down conservative opposition on the House floor by essentially daring would-be defectors to derail planned votes on Mr. Trump’s priorities. But Wednesday night was a rare instance in which the hard-right Republicans refused to blink — at least for now — and it dealt the speaker, who had confidently predicted he would have the votes to push the measure through, a bruising setback. Mr. Johnson emerged from the closed-door meeting on Wednesday night and told reporters the House would vote on the measure “probably tomorrow, one way or the other.” There were still “a small subset of members who weren’t totally satisfied” with the bill, he said. Those lawmakers, who continued to huddle privately after Mr. Johnson delayed the vote, said they were seeking more assurances that the Senate would ultimately come up with deeper spending cuts than the resolution required.

"Under a measure the G.O.P. is working to pass on Wednesday, lawmakers would give up their ability to force a vote on undoing the president’s tariffs until October.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by Under a measure the G.O.P. is working to pass on Wednesday, lawmakers would give up their ability to force a vote on undoing the president’s tariffs until October. By Robert Jimison Reporting from the Capitol House Republican leaders maneuvered on Wednesday to spare their members a politically tricky vote on President Trump’s tariffs in the coming months by tucking language into an unrelated measure that would temporarily bar lawmakers from using their power under the law to force such a vote. This is the second time Republicans have deployed the unusual procedural tactic to sideline Congress on trade matters as lawmakers continue to hear panic from constituents and donors about the adverse effects of Mr. Trump’s moves on trade. Last month, they did so as part of a measure needed to bring up a spending bill to prevent a government shutdown. On Wednesday, Republicans inserted the same kind of language into a measure needed to bring up the G.O.P. budget plan. It was scheduled for a vote later Wednesday afternoon. The move came just hours before Mr. Trump announced he was pausing most of the reciprocal tariffs he announced last week for 90 days. But it underscored the angst those levies have sown among members of Congress, including many Republicans, who could pay a political price for their impacts. The maneuver effectively deprives lawmakers in both parties who have sponsored legislation to terminate Mr. Trump’s tariffs from forcing their measures to the House floor. The National Emergencies Act allows members of Congress to take such action and have their proposals considered by a committee within 15 days and a floor vote within three days after that. But under the measure being pushed by Republicans, the House would declare the roughly six-month period until Sept. 30 a single calendar day, effectively circumventing that process. Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters that the measure left Congress with “an appropriate level of authority to deal with unfair trade practices.” He added: “The role of the president is to negotiate with other countries and other heads of state. And he’s doing that.” The Senate last week passed a measure invoking the emergencies law to end the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on Canada in February, and bipartisan groups of lawmakers in both chambers have introduced legislation to do so to terminate the new tariffs that Mr. Trump announced last week. The House Republicans’ maneuver would ensure those efforts fail, at least for now. Democrats quickly criticized the move as a ceding of congressional authority over tariffs. “Republicans are already putting in a provision to make sure that they don’t have to vote on the tariffs that are in place,” Representative Suzan DelBene, Democrat of Washington, said during a hearing on Wednesday. “Congress should have a role here. It’s terrible that my colleagues on the other side aren’t willing to have a vote.” Advertisement","tariffs measure gop working pass wednesday lawmakers give ability force vote undoing president tariffs october robert jimison reporting capitol house republican leaders maneuvered wednesday spare members politically tricky vote president trump tariffs coming months tucking language unrelated measure temporarily bar lawmakers using power law force vote second time republicans deployed unusual procedural tactic sideline congress trade matters lawmakers continue hear panic constituents donors adverse effects mr trump moves trade last month part measure needed bring spending bill prevent government shutdown wednesday republicans inserted kind language measure needed bring gop budget plan scheduled vote later wednesday afternoon move came just hours mr trump announced pausing reciprocal tariffs announced last week days underscored angst levies sown among members congress including many republicans pay political price impacts maneuver effectively deprives lawmakers parties sponsored legislation terminate mr trump tariffs forcing measures house floor national emergencies act allows members congress take action proposals considered committee within days floor vote within three days measure pushed republicans house declare roughly six month period sept single calendar day effectively circumventing process speaker mike johnson told reporters measure left congress appropriate level authority deal unfair trade practices added role president negotiate countries heads state senate last week passed measure invoking emergencies law end tariffs mr trump imposed canada february bipartisan groups lawmakers chambers introduced legislation terminate new tariffs mr trump announced last week house republicans maneuver ensure efforts fail least now democrats quickly criticized move ceding congressional authority tariffs republicans already putting provision make sure don t vote tariffs place representative suzan delbene democrat washington said hearing wednesday congress role terrible colleagues side aren t willing vote"
"Chief Justice Roberts ordered a brief pause of an appeals court ruling that had reinstated Cathy Harris and Gwynne Wilcox to positions at agencies protecting workers’ rights.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Chief Justice Roberts ordered a brief pause of an appeals court ruling that had reinstated Cathy Harris and Gwynne Wilcox to positions at agencies protecting workers’ rights. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. on Wednesday temporarily let the Trump administration remove the leaders of two independent agencies while their challenges to their dismissals move forward in court. The chief justice, acting on his own, issued an “administrative stay,” an interim measure meant to give the justices some breathing room while the full Supreme Court considers the matter. He ordered the officials to file briefs in their cases by Tuesday. Chief Justice Roberts’s order came in response to an emergency application from the administration that had asked the court to pause an appeals court ruling requiring the officials’ reinstatements. The administration also asked the court to grant review of the cases and schedule arguments at a special session of the court in May, with a decision to follow by July. “We acknowledge the concerns surrounding litigating and deciding the important questions raised by these cases on such a short timeline,” wrote D. John Sauer, the solicitor general. But he said the alternative was unacceptable, as it would allow the two agencies, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board, to be overseen by officials hostile to the administration’s goals.

"The unusual move has placed a civilian military leader in charge of a domestic law enforcement entity.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The unusual move has placed a civilian military leader in charge of a domestic law enforcement entity. By Glenn Thrush Reporting from Washington Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, has been removed as the interim head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and replaced by Daniel Driscoll, the Army secretary, four people with knowledge of the switch said on Wednesday. The highly unusual move places a civilian military leader in charge of a domestic law enforcement entity. White House officials decided to make the switch in late February, just after Mr. Patel was named the A.T.F.’s director, because the responsibilities of running two agencies were seen as too time-consuming, according to an official briefed on the situation. Mr. Driscoll was selected because he was one of the few Senate-confirmed Trump appointees available to take over, the person said. Mr. Driscoll, an Iraq war veteran who is close to Vice President JD Vance, learned over the past week that he was being handed the reins of the small, embattled federal agency responsible for enforcing the nation’s gun laws, officials said. Mr. Driscoll was traveling in Germany on Wednesday and was not immediately available for comment. But a Defense Department official confirmed that Mr. Driscoll had assumed interim leadership of the A.T.F. with very little notice in recent days. The official did not know exactly when Mr. Driscoll had assumed his additional duties. A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The decision was announced to the A.T.F.’s supervisors on Wednesday morning. It left many of the agency’s staff members stunned and concerned that the switch would mean a significant recalibration of their mission at a time when hundreds of firearms investigators have been diverted to support immigration enforcement efforts. While the appointment of Mr. Patel, a former Trump campaign surrogate, to run the A.T.F. was viewed with skepticism, the offloading of a component agency of the Justice Department to a Pentagon official is something entirely new.

They were getting yippy, you know. They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.” “Well, I’m not calling it a trade war, but I am saying that China has escalated, and President Trump responded very courageously to that. And we are going to work on a solution with our trading partners. You might even say that he goaded China into a bad position. They responded — they have shown themselves to the world to be the bad actors. And we are willing to cooperate with our allies and with our trading partners who did not retaliate. It wasn’t a hard message. Don’t retaliate. Things will turn out well.“ [unclear] “I’ll take a look at this. As time goes by, we’re going to take a look at it. There are some that have been hard. There are some that, by the nature of the company, get hit a little bit harder. And we’ll take a look at that.“ [unclear] “Just instinctively, more than anything else. I mean, you almost can’t take a pencil to paper. It’s really more of an instinct, I think, than anything else.“ By Ana Swanson and Tony Romm Reporting from Washington President Trump on Wednesday abruptly reversed course on steep global tariffs that have roiled markets, upset members of his own party and raised fears of a recession. Just hours after he put punishing levies into place on nearly 60 countries, the president said he would pause them for 90 days. But Mr. Trump did not extend that pause to China, opting instead to raise tariffs again on all Chinese imports, bringing those taxes to a whopping 125 percent. That decision came after Beijing raised its levies on American goods to 84 percent on Wednesday afternoon in an escalating tit-for-tat between the world’s largest economies. In a post on Truth Social, the president said that he had authorized “a 90 day PAUSE” in which countries would face “a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff” of 10 percent. As a result, nearly every U.S. trading partner now faces a 10 percent blanket tariff, on top of 25 percent tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on cars, steel and aluminum. Slumping markets quickly rallied after Mr. Trump’s post. The S&P 500 climbed several percentage points in a matter of minutes and closed with a rise of more than 9 percent, sharply reversing days of losses. Wednesday was the best day for the S&P 500 since the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Nearly every stock in the index rose. Airlines, some tech companies and Tesla were among those companies to soar over 20 percent. Shares of automakers rose sharply even though 25 percent tariffs on imported cars remain in place. Ford and General Motors both rose more than 7 percent. Mr. Trump, who for days had insisted he was not concerned about the market rout, acknowledged on Wednesday that the downturn had fed into his decision.

"The U.N. food program said the new cuts “could amount to a death sentence” for millions of desperate people.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","U.S.A.I.D. Advertisement Supported by The U.N. food program said the new cuts “could amount to a death sentence” for millions of desperate people. By Karoun Demirjian and Edward Wong Reporting from Washington One month ago, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration had completed its purge of foreign assistance, keeping only a small portfolio of lifesaving humanitarian aid programs in place. But in the past several days, the Trump administration has slashed many of the programs it had pledged to preserve, according to lists compiled by government officials and aid workers. The cuts threaten to leave some of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people without access to adequate supplies of food, clean water and medicine. In countries like Afghanistan and Yemen, where millions of people do not have enough food, U.S.-backed humanitarian aid was completely cut off. Several countries where conflict has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians, such as Niger and the Democratic Republic of Congo, lost millions of dollars in support for critical food assistance. The United Nations’ World Food Program, which distributes aid and coordinates shipments, said on social media that the termination of these programs “could amount to a death sentence for millions of people facing extreme hunger and starvation.” The cuts are part of the Trump administration’s efforts to erase the U.S. Agency for International Development, which for decades has been the government’s main outfit for distributing foreign aid. The State Department has said that it will take control of U.S.A.I.D.’s remaining functions by Aug. 15, and that Pete Marocco, who presided over the agency’s initial gutting, will oversee them. Like many of the Trump administration’s recent moves to decimate federal agencies, the latest rollbacks have been drastic and, at times, erratic. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The president has all but shut down the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, but his real goal appears to be a fundamental change of approach for getting people off the streets.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The president has all but shut down the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, but his real goal appears to be a fundamental change of approach for getting people off the streets. By Jason DeParle Reporting from Washington When President Trump set out last month to eviscerate a tiny agency that coordinates federal efforts to reduce homelessness, he was not just clearing bureaucratic brush. He was escalating a conservative war on how billions in federal aid gets spent, a fight that could have life-altering stakes for the record number of people sleeping on the streets. The obscure focus of Mr. Trump’s ire, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, is smaller than many Boy Scout troops. His larger target appears to be the policy that dominates homelessness work, an approach called Housing First. Once the product of bipartisan consensus, Housing First programs, which the council promotes, provide apartments to chronically homeless people without requiring them to accept services like drug treatment or mental health care. Supporters say the policy saves lives by getting treatment-wary people safely indoors, where some go on to accept services. Proponents have credited it for a signature success, the decline by more than half in the number of homeless veterans. But critics say the approach has become a stifling orthodoxy that has failed to stem the broader rise in homelessness and may abet it. Giving people long-term housing without addressing underlying problems like substance abuse or mental illness leaves them prone to homelessness again, opponents of the policy say. Detractors also say that by favoring Housing First, federal grants unfairly exclude groups like rescue missions that emphasize sobriety. The sooner the council vanishes, critics say, the faster Mr. Trump can steer a new course. “It’s an ideological and propagandist arm for failed Housing First policies,” said Devon Kurtz, a policy analyst at the conservative Cicero Institute, an Austin-based research and advocacy group. “It would have been undercutting the work of the Trump administration right off the bat.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The punitive move comes amid the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against big law firms.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The punitive move comes amid the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against big law firms. By Devlin Barrett Reporting from Washington The Justice Department on Wednesday barred its lawyers from attending any American Bar Association events, escalating the Trump administration’s battle with the legal profession over who lawyers should take on as clients. In a memo, the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, said that the bar association was “free to litigate in support of activist causes” but that the department’s employees “must conduct themselves in a manner that does not undermine or appear to undermine the department’s core mission of administering justice in a fair, effective, and evenhanded manner.” The department, Mr. Blanche wrote, “will no longer use taxpayer funds to pay for any travel to or engagement with A.B.A. events.” Any department employees who work in policy-related positions also may not “speak at, attend, or otherwise participate in” the association’s events in their official capacity, the memo continued, adding that those employees may not hold positions in the association or renew their memberships. Mr. Blanche also barred those employees from writing or publishing material in “A.B.A.-sponsored media” without his specific approval. Senior Justice Department officials have long attended and had major speaking roles at A.B.A. conferences, which draw lawyers from around the country. The new policy seems intended to put a halt to any senior department lawyers doing so again. The directive does allow for a category of exceptions: Career Justice Department lawyers who do not serve in policy-related roles may attend such events as long as they do so on their own time and at their own expense. The move came as President Trump made clear he intended to continue using the levers of government to pursue his perceived foes. He signed executive orders on Wednesday to punish the law firm Susman Godfrey and to revoke security clearances for two officials who had served in his first administration, Christopher Krebs and Miles Taylor, adding to a growing number of people and entities he has targeted. Mr. Blanche’s memo does not mention Mr. Trump’s recent executive orders aimed at punishing certain firms, or the bar association’s criticism of those and other actions by the president. It instead refers to past “friend of the court” filings that the group has made in cases about abortion, student admissions and the First Amendment. A spokesman for the association did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The group’s president, William R. Bay, said in a statement last month that clients “have the right to have access to their lawyer without interference by the government.” The American Bar Association has over 400,000 members. Its mission, according to its website, is “to be the national representative of the legal profession, serving the public and the profession by promoting justice, professional excellence and respect for the law.” Devlin Barrett covers the Justice Department and the F.B.I. for The Times.

"Elon Musk, and the feelings that working for him can engender, can come between even the closest of pals.",2025-04-09,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Newsletter Elon Musk, and the feelings that working for him can engender, can come between even the closest of pals. By Ryan Mac I’m doing something a little different with the newsletter today: delving into some reporting left over in my notebook that shows how Elon Musk — and the strong feelings that working for him can engender — can come between even the closest of friends. Last month, my colleagues and I published a story about Steve Davis, a longtime Musk lieutenant who has worked for the billionaire for more than two decades, at three different companies, and is now one of the most powerful people leading his cost-cutting effort in Washington. When Davis moved to Washington as a SpaceX employee more than 15 years ago, he developed a busy extracurricular life, running a popular frozen yogurt shop and bar; organizing kickball and competitive karaoke teams; and hosting game nights and Shabbat dinners. Much of that he did side by side with a close friend and roommate named Stephen Richer. (Here they are performing together in a flash mob for Davis’s Mr. Yogato yogurt shop. Richer is the tall redhead.) Friends called the two inseparable. Richer sang the praises of SpaceX and the Boring Company, the Musk-founded tunneling startup that Davis would go on to lead. And a few years later, after Richer had gone back to law school in Chicago and then moved to Arizona, Davis backed his buddy when, of all things, Richer — a Republican — ran for and won the 2020 election for Maricopa County recorder, which oversees voting in the state’s largest county.

"The legislation is part of an escalating Republican campaign to take aim at judges who have moved to halt some of President Trump’s executive orders.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The legislation is part of an escalating Republican campaign to take aim at judges who have moved to halt some of President Trump’s executive orders. By Michael Gold Reporting from the Capitol The House passed legislation on Wednesday that would bar federal district judges from issuing nationwide injunctions, part of an escalating Republican campaign to take aim at judges who have moved to halt some of President Trump’s executive orders. The bill, approved mostly along party lines on a vote of 219 to 213, would largely limit district court judges to issuing narrow orders that pertain to parties involved in a specific lawsuit, rather than broader ones that can block a policy or action from being enforced throughout the country. It would make an exception in cases that were brought by multiple states, which would need to be heard by a three-judge panel. It faces a slim chance of becoming law because of the obstacles it faces in the Senate, where seven Democrats would have to join Republicans to allow it to advance. So far, similar bills have not been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee. House Republicans have framed the legislation, named the No Rogue Rulings Act, as a necessary constitutional check on what they claim is an abuse of power by judges attempting to wield political influence from the bench. Citing an increase in nationwide injunctions since Mr. Trump took office, Republican lawmakers have argued that an unelected federal judge in one district should not be able to block the executive branch from implementing nationwide policies, a duty they say should be left to appeals courts or the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court “must reach a majority in order to make something the law of the land, and yet a single district judge believes that they can make the law of the land,” Representative Darrell Issa, the California Republican who introduced the bill, said on the House floor on Wednesday.

"Plucky, an African gray parrot, accompanied its owner on a Frontier Airlines flight to Puerto Rico in January. But a gate agent would not let it on board the return flight.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Plucky, an African gray parrot, accompanied its owner on a Frontier Airlines flight to Puerto Rico in January. But a gate agent would not let it on board the return flight. By Neil Vigdor Maria Fraterrigo was booked in seat 4A on a flight from San Juan to Kennedy International Airport on Saturday night. But when she got to the gate for her return flight to New York, she said, an agent for Frontier Airlines stopped her. Her companion, an African gray parrot named Plucky, which Ms. Fraterrigo has claimed as an emotional support animal and can say the names of her grandchildren, was on a no-fly list. Despite being allowed to bring Plucky on her outbound Frontier flight without incident in January, she said, the agent told her that parrots were among several types of birds and other animals prohibited by the airline. She said that rule essentially left her stranded. “This guy from the counter yells at me and tells me, ‘You’re not going to make this flight,’ ” Ms. Fraterrigo, 81, recalled in a phone interview on Wednesday. “‘Give it to somebody. Get rid of it.’ I said, ‘No way, I’m not going to get rid of my baby.’” For four days, her travel plans were stuck in limbo, until Frontier appeared to have relented, ticketing her on another flight scheduled for Wednesday night.

"Economic turmoil, particularly a rapid rise in government bond yields, caused President Trump to reverse course on the steep levies.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by Economic turmoil, particularly a rapid rise in government bond yields, caused President Trump to reverse course on the steep levies. By Tyler PagerMaggie HabermanAna Swanson and Jonathan Swan Reporting from Washington For the past week, President Trump has been urging calm in the face of the financial chaos that he created and resisting calls for him to rethink his approach. “I know what the hell I’m doing,” he told Republicans on Tuesday as the massive tariffs he had imposed sent global markets into a tailspin. “BE COOL!” he said in a social media post on Wednesday morning. “Everything is going to work out well.” At 9:37 a.m. Wednesday, the president was still bullish on his policy, posting on Truth Social: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” But in the end, it was the markets that got him to reverse course. The economic turmoil, particularly a rapid rise in government bond yields, caused Mr. Trump to blink on Wednesday afternoon and pause his “reciprocal” tariffs for most countries for the next 90 days, according to four people with direct knowledge of the president’s decision. Asked to explain the decision, Mr. Trump told reporters: “Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.” Behind the scenes, senior members of Mr. Trump’s team had feared a financial panic that could spiral out of control and potentially devastate the economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and others on the president’s team, including Vice President JD Vance, had been pushing for a more structured approach to the trade conflict that would focus on isolating China as the worst actor while still sending a broader message that Mr. Trump was serious about cracking down on trade imbalances.

"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit sided with the government to block a lower-court ruling that had led to the reinstatement of thousands of federal workers.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Federal Layoffs Advertisement Supported by The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit sided with the government to block a lower-court ruling that had led to the reinstatement of thousands of federal workers. By Eileen Sullivan Eileen Sullivan reports on the federal work force. The Trump administration is once again free to fire probationary employees. For now. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in a 2-to-1 decision, sided with the government on Wednesday to block a lower-court ruling in Maryland that had led to the reinstatement of thousands of federal workers who had been fired in February. The purge of the employees had marked one of the first stages of President Trump’s plan to rapidly downsize the civil service and overhaul or eliminate entire offices and programs. Since then, the status of the workers has been tied up in legal battles over whether the firings had been carried out lawfully. The Wednesday appeals court decision came a day after the Supreme Court blocked a similar ruling in California reining in the government in a separate case. There is now no court order in place to stop the government from firing probationary employees. Both courts ruled on narrow issues of standing: whether the probationary firings harmed the plaintiffs so much that they had the right to sue in district court. In California, nonprofit organizations sued the government over the firings at six agencies because they said they benefited from the services the federal workers provided. In Maryland, 19 states and the District of Columbia sued 20 federal agencies, arguing that the government was obligated to give them notice when personnel actions could abruptly and significantly increase demand for unemployment benefits. It was not immediately clear what the latest decision meant for the thousands of fired probationary employees, nearly all of whom had been recently reinstated as a result of district court orders. The back-and-forth has left the employees in a state of limbo, wondering if they will be fired again after having just been rehired. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The president targeted two officials from his first administration and an elite law firm as part of his campaign for retribution.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The president targeted two officials from his first administration and an elite law firm as part of his campaign for retribution. By Chris Cameron Reporting from Washington President Trump on Wednesday signed executive orders punishing two officials from his first administration and an elite law firm, continuing a campaign of retribution that he has gleefully carried out since his inauguration. Two executive orders targeted Christopher Krebs, who as a senior cybersecurity official oversaw the securing of the 2020 presidential election, and Miles Taylor, who served as chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security during Mr. Trump’s first term and anonymously wrote a high-profile opinion article for The New York Times in 2018. Among other measures, the orders directed Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, to investigate the former officials and report their findings to the White House. A third order targeted the law firm Susman Godfrey with many of the same sanctions that Mr. Trump has applied to other law firms that had taken on cases or causes he did not like. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay $787.5 million to resolve a defamation suit filed by Dominion Voting Systems over the network’s promotion of misinformation about the 2020 election. Susman Godfrey represented Dominion, a manufacturer of voting machines that lawyers allied with Mr. Trump attacked with outlandish claims about widespread voting fraud. The executive orders reflected Mr. Trump’s desire for political payback. Mr. Trump has fixated on punishing — among others — elected Republicans and officials in his administration who have defied him or later opposed him. Mr. Trump has also sought to rewrite the history of his defeat in 2020, and has continued to repeat his lie that the election was stolen from him. Mr. Krebs, leading the agency tasked with protecting election machinery from foreign interference, shot down many of Mr. Trump’s false claims of widespread fraud, and Mr. Trump fired Mr. Krebs days after his loss. Mr. Trump has continued to harbor deep resentments against the agency. “This guy, Krebs, was saying ‘oh the election was great,’” Mr. Trump said Wednesday as he signed the order. He added, of Mr. Krebs,:“He’s the fraud. He’s a disgrace.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

By Zolan Kanno-Youngs Reporting from Washington President Trump began his Wednesday with some advice for those rattled by his steep tariffs. “BE COOL,” Mr. Trump told his followers on social media after the markets opened. Just a couple of minutes later he wrote, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT” Hours after that, Mr. Trump sent the markets soaring when he paused the levies for 90 days. The S&P 500 climbed several percentage points in a matter of minutes and was on its way to its best day since the recovery of the 2008 financial crisis. Soon after Mr. Trump’s pause, Democrats and government ethics experts asked the perhaps obvious question: Did Mr. Trump give the green light to his followers to cash in on a forthcoming rise in stock prices? “How is this not market manipulation?” Representative Mike Levin, Democrat of California, said on social media, referring to action that is potentially illegal. “If you’re a Trump supporter and you did what he said and you bought, then you did great. On the other hand, if you’re a retiree or a senior or somebody in the middle class over the last few days that didn’t have the tolerance for risk and you decided to sell, you got screwed.” The news of Mr. Trump’s pause came as Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, was testifying on Capitol Hill. Representative Steven Horsford, Democrat of Nevada, pressed him on Mr. Trump’s aim. “It’s not market manipulation,” Mr. Greer said. “We’re trying to reset the global trading system.” “How have you achieved any of that?” Mr. Horsford asked. “So if it’s not market manipulation, what is it?

By Yan Zhuang How long does it take you to wet your hair in the shower? A few seconds? A minute? The president of the United States, who has long complained about being unable to coax more than a dribble or trickle of water from his showers, says it takes him much longer. “I like to take a nice shower to take care of my beautiful hair,” President Trump said on Wednesday in the Oval Office. “I stand under the shower for 15 minutes until it gets wet. It comes out drip, drip, drip. It’s ridiculous.” Much of the world was focused at that moment on his trade war, but Mr. Trump wanted to talk about showers. He offered this insight while signing an executive order to loosen restrictions on water flow from American shower heads. The order directs Energy Secretary Chris Wright to rescind a definition of shower heads first implemented by President Barack Obama. It is the second time that Mr. Trump as president has attempted to redefine a shower head. A rule he introduced in his first term drastically increased the amount of water that showers with multiple nozzles could use. The Biden administration later reversed that change. “No longer will shower heads be weak and worthless,” the White House said in a news release on Wednesday. How big of an issue is this, really? And how many ways can you define a shower head? For Mr. Trump, it has been a long-running crusade. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By John Yoon The authorities in Los Angeles said on Wednesday that they had arrested a woman and charged her with attempted murder after she pointed a gun at officers who were on an unrelated manhunt. Police officers were pursuing the suspects in a hit-and-run case who had fled into the Eagle Rock neighborhood of Los Angeles on Tuesday. When they arrived at the back of a house where one of the suspects had last been seen, they saw a woman armed with a handgun in the yard of a neighboring house, the police said. They later identified her as Jillian Lauren Shriner, 51. Ms. Shriner is an author and is married to Scott Shriner, who plays bass in the rock band Weezer. The officers asked Ms. Shriner to drop the weapon numerous times but she refused. The officers shot her when she pointed the gun at them, the L.A.P.D. said in a statement. She went into the house, which the police later learned was her home, and was taken into custody when she came out. The police said she was treated at a hospital for a gunshot wound that was not life-threatening, and that no other injuries were reported. Officers found a 9-millimeter handgun at her house, the police said. Ms. Shriner was charged early Wednesday with attempted murder, with bail set at $1 million, according to the public arrest record. She was released on bond Wednesday night. Ms. Shriner has written two best-selling memoirs as Jillian Lauren: “Some Girls: My Life in a Harem” (2010) and “Everything You Ever Wanted” (2015). Her husband is scheduled to perform with Weezer at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on Saturday. Ms. Shriner’s manager did not respond to a request for comment early Thursday.

"Some young people are spending their savings on an extended break earlier in their careers rather than waiting until retirement.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Some young people are spending their savings on an extended break earlier in their careers rather than waiting until retirement. By Isabella Kwai Marina Kausar wasn’t sure what to call the three-month break she took after quitting her job. After working in a series of jobs in finance and technology, Ms. Kausar, 30, was feeling stressed and overworked. In December 2023, with a bit of savings built up, she quit without another position lined up to focus on things that had fallen to the wayside while she was focused on work. “I had more time to work out. I was eating better, sleeping better. It was just like a full reset,” said Ms. Kausar, who lives in Houston. “For the first time in my adult life, I didn’t have this looming cloud of ‘work.’” Eventually, she came across a term for her hiatus that resonated with her: “micro-retirement.” For most people in the United States, being able to save enough money to not have to work is a faraway ideal. That anxiety, especially for people closer to retirement, has only risen as stock markets have grown more volatile in response to President Trump’s global tariffs. Discontented employees who do not have the means to leave the work force have turned to “quiet-quitting,” “acting your wage” or simply using their vacation days. Now, many younger workers are opting not to wait until retirement, and are leaving an extended gap between jobs to invest in other parts of their life. But not everyone wants to call it a sabbatical: Some people prefer the term “mini-retirement” or “micro-retirement.” “Sabbaticals are seen as the thing that an organization offers to you for paid time off, and then you come back to that job,” said Kira Schabram, an assistant professor at the University of Washington who is researching such breaks. “People are just taking it into their own hands.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Proponents say the devices have helped address inequities in the criminal justice system. But many defendants have experienced unintended consequences.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Proponents say the devices have helped address inequities in the criminal justice system. But many defendants have experienced unintended consequences. By Taylor Tiamoyo Harris Taylor Tiamoyo Harris is examining the courts and bail bond systems in St. Louis as a part of The Times’s Local Investigations Fellowship. In the heat of an argument last spring, Khyla Mason raised a handgun into the air on a neighbor’s porch. She was acting in self-defense, she said, and never fired, but the confrontation was captured on video, and some children were nearby. Ms. Mason wound up in a St. Louis jail charged with unlawful use of a weapon. Just a few years ago, someone facing the same charge in St. Louis was likely to pay a small bond and resume life as usual until trial, local attorneys said. But Ms. Mason, who was then 21, was released from jail with a box the size of a deck of cards strapped to her right ankle. It tracked her every move. For weeks, the device alerted officials each time she missed her court-imposed curfew or left her house without approval. Sometimes, she was buying food or diapers for her 2-year-old son, or taking him to the hospital, she said. After more than two dozen violations, she was sent back to jail. She remained there for a month. More and more defendants across the country are being placed on electronic monitors, part of an ambitious effort to prevent overcrowding in the nation’s jails and keep people from being imprisoned while awaiting trial for minor offenses. Like courts in Baltimore, Dallas and Los Angeles, the St. Louis city circuit court is among those that have embraced electronic monitoring as a powerful reform of the cash bail system. The number of new monitors activated here more than doubled from the first half of 2021 to the first half of 2024, when it surpassed 550, a New York Times analysis found.

The sprawling oak tree, more than 150 years old, near the first tee and clubhouse at Augusta National Golf Club, where the Masters Tournament begins on Thursday.Credit... Supported by By Alan Blinder Photographs by Doug Mills Alan Blinder and Doug Mills have sneezed through years of Masters Tournaments. At the Masters Tournament, beneath a towering oak tree, executives, sports agents, well-connected golf fans and club members in green jackets mingle as past and aspiring champions roam. Bring a business card. Better yet, bring an antihistamine. Augusta National Golf Club, where the Masters is held, boasts one of the world’s most beloved courses. It also presents a sniffle-and-sneeze-laden assault on the senses at this time of year. The oak by the clubhouse is but one of its scourges. “The pollen is just killing my eyes,” Tiger Woods said years ago after he donned sunglasses at a Masters. “I’ve been sneezing and hacking all week, so trying to keep it out of my eyes the best I can.” Pollen, it turns out, is an equalizer of players and patrons, as Augusta National refers to the spectators who gaze upon great golf. Given the hundreds of acres of manicured Bermuda grass and majestic pine, oak and magnolia trees, the cost can be misery. The tournament begins Thursday, and weather conditions will help dictate how high the pollen counts peak by the time the tournament is scheduled to conclude on Sunday evening. Pollen-cleaning rain on Monday brought some relief. That relief was soon gone. “I get out of my car in the morning, my eyes start watering,” Scottie Scheffler, the world’s top-ranked player and the winner of the 2022 and 2024 Masters, said this week. “It’s a little bit worse than normal years.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Some State Department officials have proposed closing the embassy in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, as a precaution after recent gains by Al Shabab militants.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Some State Department officials have proposed closing the embassy in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, as a precaution after recent gains by Al Shabab militants. By Charlie Savage and Eric Schmitt Charlie Savage and Eric Schmitt reported from Washington. Recent battlefield gains by an Islamist insurgency in Somalia have prompted some State Department officials to propose closing the U.S. embassy in Mogadishu and withdrawing most American personnel as a security precaution, according to officials familiar with internal deliberations. But other Trump administration officials, centered in the National Security Council, are worried that shutting the embassy could diminish confidence in Somalia’s central government and inadvertently incite a rapid collapse. Instead, they want to double down on U.S. operations in the war-torn country as it seeks to counter the militant group, Al Shabab, the officials said. The rival concerns are being fueled by memories of foreign policy debacles like the 2012 attack by Islamist militants who overran the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, and the abrupt collapse of the Afghan government as American forces withdrew in 2021. They also underscore the broader dilemma for the Trump administration as it determines its strategy for Somalia, a chaotic and dysfunctional country fractured by complex clan dynamics, where the United States has waged a low-intensity counterterrorism war for some two decades with little progress. The considerations are appearing to pit President Trump’s top counterterrorism adviser, Sebastian Gorka, who has a hawkish approach to using force against militant Islamists, against more isolationist elements of Mr. Trump’s coalition. That group, sick of the “forever wars” that followed the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, does not see a major U.S. interest in Somalia. Last week, Mr. Gorka convened an interagency meeting at the White House to begin to grapple with an approach, according to officials briefed on its findings who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations.

Now, Ms. Harris wanted to make it known she was uncomfortable with such acquiescence. “There is a sense of fear that is taking hold in our country,” she told an audience of Black women on April 3, in some of her most forceful remarks since November. Her voice rising, she added: “We are seeing those that are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats.” Five months after being driven from public office for the first time in more than two decades, the former vice president is carefully feeling her way forward. As she plots her next move, she is navigating between a president who is using his executive power to crush those he sees as his strongest adversaries and restive Democrats who want their leaders to be the picture of defiance. Friends, former aides and advisers say Ms. Harris, 60, still thinks she would have beaten Mr. Trump if she’d had more than 107 days to campaign — the implication being that former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should have quit the race earlier. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"A new crop of Democrats are announcing runs for office — sometimes against incumbents — in an expression of frustration with the establishment.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by A new crop of Democrats are announcing runs for office — sometimes against incumbents — in an expression of frustration with the establishment. By Kellen Browning George Hornedo, a liberal activist and Democratic Party strategist in Indianapolis, had already been weighing a primary challenge to the local congressman when he was confronted last month by a senior Indiana Democrat. Asked whether he was planning a run, Mr. Hornedo, 34, acknowledged he was considering it. The woman, he recalled, told him he was “going to get hurt.” He posted his recounting of the interaction on TikTok, where it quickly went viral. “Don’t let them scare you off,” one commenter wrote. On Wednesday, Mr. Hornedo announced his campaign against the nine-term incumbent, Representative André Carson, while deriding him and those like him as “do-nothing Democrats” and promising a new generation of leadership for Washington. “The Democratic Party cannot win the future with a leadership structure that is built for the past,” he said in an interview. A small but growing group of young Democrats are being propelled to act by outrage among rank-and-file voters, and especially among young people. Infuriated by the early months of President Trump’s second term, impatient with the status quo and frustrated with party leadership, they are mounting bids for office. In California, Jake Rakov, 37, a onetime Capitol Hill aide to Representative Brad Sherman, 70, is challenging his former boss. And even Representative Nancy Pelosi, 85, the California Democrat who stepped down from her two-decade leadership role in 2023, faces a primary challenge, from Saikat Chakrabarti, 39, the former campaign manager for Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who ran a similar playbook in her first race for Congress. Some of these efforts look like long shots against well-funded and better-known incumbents. But they amount to a manifestation of the anger felt by voters toward the Democratic Party — after President Joseph R. Biden Jr., ignoring their concerns, waited until late in the game to abandon his attempt at re-election — and the sentiment that a younger generation might be better equipped to oppose Mr. Trump.

"The former first lady said on a podcast that people “couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself, that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.”",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The former first lady said on a podcast that people “couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself, that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.” By Claire Moses It’s not quite an age-old adage, but at this point it has long been true: Don’t believe everything you read on the internet. Michelle Obama, the former first lady, reminded people of this in a recent podcast interview. In rare public comments about her personal life, she discussed swirling rumors that she and her husband, former President Barack Obama, were headed for divorce, and tacitly explained why she didn’t attend President Trump’s inauguration. The gossip about a possible split was fueled by Mrs. Obama’s absence from two major public events in January that her husband attended: former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral and President Trump’s inauguration. While her absence at Mr. Carter’s funeral was attributed to a scheduling conflict, a statement about her absence at the inauguration did not include an explanation. Mrs. Obama now has offered at least a partial answer: She is making decisions for herself. “I chose to do what’s best for me, not what I had to do,” she said this week on an episode of “Work in Progress,” a podcast hosted by the actress Sophia Bush, referencing a “real big example” of something on her calendar that she skipped. People “couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself, that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing,” she said. “This couldn’t be a grown woman just making a set of decisions for herself, right? But that is what society does to us.” That was as close as Mrs. Obama got to directly addressing the rumors of marital discord. And she did not mention Mr. Trump by name on the podcast. In the past, she has expressed dislike for the president, who promoted the lie that her husband was not a U.S. citizen. “Now is the time for me to start asking myself these hard questions of, ‘Who do I truly want to be every day?’” Mrs. Obama said. “And that changes.” On the roughly hourlong episode, Mrs. Obama did not waste many words on the rumors, nor did she go into detail. Instead, she emphasized the importance of making her own decisions, especially now that she no longer occupies the White House and her two daughters are adults. “I learned that I can really only control me,” Mrs. Obama said. Claire Moses is a Times reporter in London, focused on coverage of breaking and trending news.

"Egg prices have reached record highs as bird flu outbreaks have hit poultry farms and forced producers to cull tens of millions of hens.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Egg prices have reached record highs as bird flu outbreaks have hit poultry farms and forced producers to cull tens of millions of hens. By Madeleine Ngo For weeks, President Trump has repeatedly boasted that his administration had managed to bring egg prices down. But new data on Thursday showed that egg prices at the grocery store continued to climb in March. Egg prices rose 5.9 percent over the month, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They climbed at a slower rate, though, after rising 10.4 percent in February and 15.2 percent in January. Compared with a year earlier, egg prices were up 60.4 percent. Egg prices have reached record highs in recent months as bird flu outbreaks have hit poultry farms and forced producers to cull tens of millions of hens. But Mr. Trump, who vowed on the campaign trail to bring down grocery prices, has continued to claim victory on egg prices. This month, he said egg prices had dropped 59 percent, and on Monday, he said egg prices were down 79 percent. Consumers might not be feeling relief because the president is not referring to retail egg prices. He is instead pointing to the wholesale price of eggs, which has fallen by roughly half since the start of his second term. Wholesale egg prices dropped from a national average of $6.55 a dozen on Jan. 24 to $3.26 last Friday, according to data from the Agriculture Department. Wholesale egg prices are also down from a peak of more than $8 a dozen at the end of February. But the average retail price for a dozen large eggs reached $6.23 in March, up from $5.90 the month before, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

"Most Republicans welcomed the unexpected three-month pause on several of President Trump’s tariffs, but some want more clarity about the president’s end game and more power for Congress over trade.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by Most Republicans welcomed the unexpected three-month pause on several of President Trump’s tariffs, but some want more clarity about the president’s end game and more power for Congress over trade. By Robert Jimison and Maya C. Miller Reporting from the Capitol President Trump’s whipsawing tariff policy has prompted bipartisan alarm on Capitol Hill, where Democrats are outraged and Republicans are caught between their deep opposition to tariffs and fear of criticizing Mr. Trump. The president’s abrupt announcement on Wednesday that he would halt most of his reciprocal tariffs for 90 days just a week after announcing them allayed the immediate concerns of some G.O.P. lawmakers, many of whom rushed to praise Mr. Trump for what they characterized as deal-making mastery. But behind those statements was a deep well of nervousness among Republican lawmakers who are hearing angst from their constituents and donors about the impact of Mr. Trump’s trade moves on the financial markets and the economy. Some of them have begun signing onto measures that would end the tariffs altogether or claw back Congress’s power to block the president from imposing such levies in the future. “I’m just trying to figure out whose throat I get to choke if it’s wrong, and who I put up on a platform and thank them for the novel approach that was successful if they’re right,” Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, said of the sweeping tariffs on Tuesday during a hearing with Jamieson Greer, the Trump administration’s top trade official. On Wednesday, after Mr. Trump pulled back most of the tariffs but retained a 10 percent tariff rate for most countries and announced additional penalties on China, Mr. Tillis still sounded anxious. He said the move was likely to “reduce some of the escalation,” but added that there was still considerable work to be done to prevent another market meltdown. “We’ve got to get a deal before we get rid of uncertainty,” he told reporters soon after Mr. Trump announced the change in a social media post.

"A critical bloc of fiscal hawks dropped its opposition after a pledge from the top Senate Republican that his chamber would embrace far deeper cuts than the measure would require.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by A critical bloc of fiscal hawks dropped its opposition after a pledge from the top Senate Republican that his chamber would embrace far deeper cuts than the measure would require. By Catie Edmondson Reporting from the Capitol The House on Thursday narrowly adopted a Republican budget blueprint for slashing taxes and government spending, after hard-line conservatives concerned that it would balloon the nation’s debt ended a revolt that had threatened to derail President Trump’s domestic agenda. Approval of the plan, which was in doubt until nearly the very end, was a victory for Republican leaders and Mr. Trump. It allowed them to move forward with crafting major legislation to enact a huge tax cut, financed with deep reductions in spending on federal programs, and pushing it through Congress over Democratic opposition. “President Trump’s promises will be fulfilled,” Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters just off the House floor shortly after the vote, “and we’re really excited that today we took a big step in getting that done.” But approval came only after a mutiny on the House floor on Tuesday night that underscored the deep divisions Republicans still have to bridge in order to push through what Mr. Trump has called his “big, beautiful bill.” It forced Mr. Johnson to delay a planned vote on the measure after he spent more than an hour Wednesday night huddled with the holdouts, trying without success to persuade them to support it. The vote on Thursday was 216 to 214, with two Republicans opposing the measure. All Democrats present voted against the plan, which they said would pave the way for cuts to Medicaid and other vital safety net programs that would harm Americans, all to pay for large tax cuts for the wealthiest. “You target earned benefits and things that are important to the American people, like Medicaid,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the Democratic leader, said, addressing Republicans. “And what are you doing it for? What is it in service of? All to pass massive tax breaks for your billionaire donors like Elon Musk.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Michael Crowley and Maggie Haberman Reporting from Washington President Trump’s longtime goal of claiming Greenland for America has shifted from rhetoric to official U.S. policy as the White House moves forward on a formal plan to acquire the Arctic island from Denmark. The plan mobilizes several cabinet departments behind Mr. Trump’s years of talk about wanting Greenland, whose economic and strategic value has grown as warming temperatures melt Arctic ice. Greenland’s size — 836,330 square miles — also offers Mr. Trump, a former Manhattan developer, the chance to clinch what he may see as one of history’s greatest real estate deals. Danish officials angrily insist that the sparsely populated island is not for sale and cannot be annexed. But Mr. Trump has made clear his determination to control it. “We need Greenland for national security and even international security, and we’re working with everybody involved to try and get it,” he said in an address to Congress last month. “One way or the other, we’re going to get it,” Mr. Trump added.

"As legal challenges to the Trump administration mount, the justices are facing a key test — a flood of “emergency applications” asking for immediate intervention.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by As legal challenges to the Trump administration mount, the justices are facing a key test — a flood of “emergency applications” asking for immediate intervention. By Abbie VanSickle Reporting from Washington The Trump administration has in recent weeks asked the Supreme Court to allow it to end birthright citizenship, to freeze more than a billion dollars in foreign aid and to permit the deportation of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador without due process. In each case, the administration told the justices the request was an emergency. By filing so-called emergency applications, the administration has asked for immediate intervention from the nation’s highest court 10 times so far — more than the total number of such requests during the 16 years of the presidencies of Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Trump administration lawyers have repeatedly told the justices their intercession is necessary to quickly undo the decisions of lower court judges who have imposed temporary pauses on large swaths of President Trump’s agenda. The Supreme Court has in recent years heard about 60 to 80 traditional “merits” cases each term. These cases often arrive at the court only after months or years of consideration by lower courts. The justices do not issue opinions until after reading extensive briefs, listening to oral arguments and meeting to discuss and exchanging multiple drafts of decisions. But an emergency application is fast-tracked, with rulings expected within days or weeks of filing after limited briefing and no arguments. Traditionally reserved for clearly urgent matters — most often requests for stays of execution for people sentenced to death — they are now the favored path to challenge so-called nationwide injunctions, where a single federal judge issues a ruling that affects not only the parties to a case but the entire nation. Critics say emergency applications, also known as “the shadow docket,” force the justices to consider cases of enormous consequence — abortion rights, Covid-19 mandates and environmental regulations — quickly and without a fully developed record from lower courts. The applications now make up a significant amount of the justices’ workload, crowding their other cases. For a court whose work is already veiled in secrecy, the emergency docket adds another layer of mystery because the court releases little information about its deliberative process on the applications, and the rulings often do not include the court’s reasoning or even a vote count.

"The A.T.F. has been hit by the departure of key career officials, the diversion of agents from core duties to immigration enforcement and from what amounts to a campaign of indifference.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by news Analysis The A.T.F. has been hit by the departure of key career officials, the diversion of agents from core duties to immigration enforcement and from what amounts to a campaign of indifference. By Glenn Thrush Reporting from Washington The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — a small government agency tasked with the titanic challenge of stemming the spread of illegal guns — has long been regarded as the spurned stepchild of federal law enforcement. It is fast becoming an orphan. The bureau, responsible for enforcing gun laws and regulating firearms dealers, enjoyed a brief but consequential revival during the Biden administration. It led a four-year push to expand background checks on buyers, crack down on untraceable homemade weapons known as “ghost guns” and curtail the use of devices that convert standard weapons into machine guns. That ended when President Trump took office. Since then, the A.T.F., a division of the Justice Department, has been ravaged by the departure of key career personnel, the diversion of dozens of agents from core duties to immigration enforcement and from what amounts to a campaign of indifference — leaving it rudderless, leaderless and demoralized. On Wednesday morning, the A.T.F.’s roughly 10,000 employees were handed off from a distracted caretaker, the F.B.I. director Kash Patel, and dumped on the bureaucratic doorstep of the Army secretary. The secretary, Daniel Driscoll, had only been told he was being saddled with the assignment a few days before, according to people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to publicly discuss the matter. The highly unusual move placed a civilian military leader in charge of a domestic law enforcement entity for the first time in memory, and critics of the administration were quick to discern sinister motives. The truth was less menacing, if no less damning for an agency Republicans have long sought to handcuff and marginalize: Mr. Patel was too busy doing his day job, and Mr. Driscoll had been confirmed by the Senate, a prerequisite for taking over.

"Ben Wikler, who supercharged fund-raising as the leader of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, is stepping down — and weighing a run for office.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Ben Wikler, who supercharged fund-raising as the leader of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, is stepping down — and weighing a run for office. By Reid J. Epstein Reid J. Epstein has been reporting on Wisconsin politics on and off since 2002. Ben Wikler, who built the Wisconsin Democratic Party into a fund-raising colossus over his six years as its leader, is leaving his post in June. Mr. Wikler, 44, said in an interview on Wednesday that he was considering running for office but would first spend time taking vacations with his three young children. “The best time to pass the torch is when an organization’s on the upswing,” he said. “I’m able to step away from the party this June knowing that Democrats are poised to make enormous gains in Wisconsin.” Mr. Wikler’s announcement comes a week after he oversaw a decisive victory in a Wisconsin Supreme Court election. Barring an unexpected vacancy, the result cements a liberal majority on the court until at least 2028. He will leave behind a state party with aspirations of winning full control of Wisconsin’s government in next year’s midterm elections — something that would have been just a dream when he took over in 2019. At that time, Republicans had led both chambers of the State Legislature since 2011, and conservatives had controlled the State Supreme Court since 2008. Now, Mr. Wikler — who wants Democrats to run a “permanent campaign” that never lets up — forecast a liberal resurgence in opposition to President Trump. He predicted that Democrats would win a governing trifecta in Wisconsin as they sweep elections across the country. The party now controls the governor’s office and the state’s top court, with Republicans holding on to majorities in the Legislature. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The invasive northern snakehead, which has recently been appearing in Missouri and other states, must be eradicated, officials say.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The invasive northern snakehead, which has recently been appearing in Missouri and other states, must be eradicated, officials say. By Victor Mather The northern snakehead — a sharp-toothed fish that looks like a horrifying hybrid of fish and snake — is spreading throughout the waters of the United States. That’s not good. But if you fish, you can help. It’s easy: Just kill that sucker. The snakehead is not a fish you especially want to meet when spending a peaceful day on the lake. Aside from everything else, snakeheads — gulp — can breathe air. And they don’t just look scary. Left unchecked, northern snakeheads can also threaten native species. “Because they’re out of their natural environment, where they evolved in a food web that has checks and balances between predator and prey, they often grow and reproduce and spread really rapidly,” said Angela Sokolowski, the invasive species coordinator at the Missouri Department of Conservation. “They could outcompete the natives. They essentially are the bigger player, without good competition, and they become resource hogs.” And it’s not just fish. Snakeheads will happily dine on crustaceans like crayfish as well. Ms. Sokolowski and officials in other states have been calling on residents to join the fight against the northern snakehead as angler season gets underway. The northern snakehead is native to Asia. It was first found in the United States in a Maryland pond in 2002, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. From there to the Potomac River, rivers in Pennsylvania and onward.

"The Texas Republican, a holdout on the plan until the end, said commitments from President Trump and G.O.P. senators to pursue deeper spending cuts persuaded him to vote yes.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Texas Republican, a holdout on the plan until the end, said commitments from President Trump and G.O.P. senators to pursue deeper spending cuts persuaded him to vote yes. By Catie Edmondson Reporting from the Capitol For days before the House voted on Thursday to adopt the Republican budget blueprint for slashing taxes and spending, Representative Chip Roy of Texas made it clear that he did not believe the measure contained enough cuts to government programs. “The math isn’t mathing,” he would repeat to reporters. Mr. Roy ended up being one of more than a dozen G.O.P. holdouts who ultimately supported the resolution on Thursday. Not long afterward, he explained his turnabout. He said he had “reluctantly voted” for the measure only after President Trump and his party’s House and Senate leaders had promised privately that they would embrace far more spending reductions, specifically deep cuts to entitlement programs including Medicaid and the elimination of clean energy tax credits. Those commitments, which Mr. Roy outlined in a lengthy statement released not long after the vote, were aimed at preserving the kind of deep spending cuts Mr. Roy and other conservatives in the House had agitated for, and some senators had resisted. Finding the votes necessary to pass legislation that adheres to those vows will be difficult. Mr. Roy said that Mr. Trump had committed to “a minimum of $1 trillion in real reductions in mandatory spending,” the portion of federal funding not controlled by Congress, most of which goes to entitlement programs for the poor, older people, veterans and others. He also said the president had committed to “efforts to fully repeal the damaging ‘green scam’ subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act” and “Medicaid reforms addressing eligibility, waste, fraud, abuse, and the disastrous money laundering schemes pervasive in the program.” Some of Mr. Roy’s more moderate colleagues, in both the House and the Senate, have chafed at the prospect of cuts to Medicaid and other safety net programs. They have also objected to the wholesale repeal of the inflation law in an effort to protect the clean energy tax credits it provides to businesses in their districts and states.

"House Republicans are so intent on avoiding tough votes on President Trump’s tariffs that they have rewritten the calendar.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Congressional Memo House Republicans are so intent on avoiding tough votes on President Trump’s tariffs that they have rewritten the calendar. By Maya C. Miller Reporting from the Capitol What if you could prolong today to avoid making an uncomfortable decision tomorrow? For most human beings, that’s not possible. But in the alternate reality that is Congress, which operates according to its own arcane rules and precedents and is exempt from the statutes that bind the rest of us, a day can be as long or short as the laws of political gravity demand. That is how it came to pass that House Republicans in recent weeks declared the rest of the year one long day when it came to considering a challenge to President Trump’s tariffs. They would prefer to avoid votes on whether to scrap the levies, but the law says the House must consider them within a set period of time. The obvious solution? Stop time. It was hardly the first time congressional leaders have meddled with the laws of the universe for the sake of political expediency. By bending legislative time, House and Senate leaders have long found ways to buy themselves wiggle room for negotiation, preserve their prerogatives and shield their members from votes they would rather not have to cast. Four years ago, Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker, kept the House in recess overnight rather than adjourning to stretch a single “legislative day” across two calendar days. The move allowed her to claim she had kept a promise that she had made to moderate Democrats that she would hold a vote on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill by the end of the month. Speaker Mike Johnson’s recent efforts to freeze time have been more conspicuous — and longer lasting. Last month, he quietly pushed through a provision that contained a calendar gimmick ensuring that no lawmaker could force a vote this year to end Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico. He used the same trick on Wednesday to head off a vote until at least October on the global tariffs Mr. Trump announced last week and then partially paused. The first measure stated that “each day for the remainder of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day” for the purposes of the emergency Mr. Trump declared on Feb. 1 to impose the tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico. The resolution approved on Wednesday used the same language to stop any member from forcing a vote on the rest of Mr. Trump’s tariffs through Sept. 30.

"Conservatives have long argued for stronger laws to combat voter fraud, something that election experts say is exceedingly rare.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Conservatives have long argued for stronger laws to combat voter fraud, something that election experts say is exceedingly rare. By Michael Gold Reporting from the Capitol The House on Thursday passed legislation that would require people to prove that they are U.S. citizens when they register to vote, the latest effort in a Republican-led push to tighten voting laws that is tied to President Trump’s debunked claims of widespread election fraud. Voting by noncitizens happens rarely, and it is already illegal in federal elections. But Mr. Trump and his Republican allies repeatedly insisted throughout his 2024 campaign that noncitizens were flooding to the polls as he railed against immigration and tried to sow doubt about election integrity. The House bill, which passed on a vote of 220 to 208, would order states to obtain proof of citizenship, such as a passport or a birth certificate, in person from those seeking to register to vote. It would also require states to remove noncitizens from their voter rolls. The legislation echoes a far-reaching executive order that Mr. Trump signed last month in an effort to change U.S. voting rules to address grievances stemming from his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Four centrist-leaning Democrats joined Republicans to pass the bill, known as the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or SAVE, Act. But it faces long odds in the Senate, where seven Democrats would have to join Republicans to allow it to proceed to a vote. Conservatives have long argued for stronger laws to combat voter fraud, something that election experts say is exceedingly rare. For years, they have pushed for laws requiring voters to offer photo identification when they arrive at the polls. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"By placing migrants in Social Security’s “death master file,” the Trump administration is seeking to cut off their access to credit cards, bank accounts and other financial services.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration  By placing migrants in Social Security’s “death master file,” the Trump administration is seeking to cut off their access to credit cards, bank accounts and other financial services.  By placing migrants in Social Security’s “death master file,” the Trump administration is seeking to cut off their access to credit cards, bank accounts and other financial services. Migrants who arrived in New York last year waited for shelter assignments at the Roosevelt Hotel.Credit...Todd Heisler/The New York Times Supported by By Alexandra BerzonHamed AleazizNicholas NehamasRyan Mac and Tara Siegel Bernard Since taking office, the Trump administration has moved aggressively to revoke the temporary legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were allowed into the country under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Now, the administration is taking drastic steps to pressure some of those immigrants and others who had legal status to “self-deport” by effectively canceling the Social Security numbers they had lawfully obtained, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times and interviews with six people familiar with the plans. The goal is to cut those people off from using crucial financial services like bank accounts and credit cards, along with their access to government benefits. The effort hinges on a surprising new tactic: repurposing Social Security’s “death master file,” which for years has been used to track dead people who should no longer receive benefits, to include the names of living people who the government believes should be treated as if they are dead. As a result of being added to the death database, they would be blacklisted from a coveted form of identity that allows them to make and more easily spend money. Earlier this week, the names of more than 6,300 migrants whose legal status had just been revoked were added to the file, according to the documents. The initial names are limited to people the administration says are convicted criminals and “suspected terrorists,” the documents show. But officials said the effort could broaden to include others in the country without authorization.

Representative Grace Meng said that, in 10 years of flying to and from Washington, “This has never happened to me.” By Neil Vigdor Two American Airlines jets, including one carrying at least six members of Congress from New York and New Jersey, clipped wings on a taxiway at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington on Thursday, officials said. There were no injuries, according to American Airlines, which said that the damage was limited to the winglets of the two planes and that both jets had been taken out of service for inspection. The six House members were departing for Kennedy International Airport when the right winglet of their Embraer E175, which was stationary, was clipped by a regional jet heading to Charleston, S.C., officials said. “I’ve been flying for over 10 years to Washington,” Representative Grace Meng, Democrat of New York, said during a Zoom call with reporters while waiting for another flight. “This has never happened to me.” Ms. Meng, whose district is in Queens, identified the other House members who were aboard the flight as Gregory Meeks, Ritchie Torres, Adriano Espaillat, all Democrats from New York; Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey; and Nick LaLota, a Long Island Republican. Ms. Meng said that she was sitting on the other side of the plane from where the wings clipped. “We suddenly felt some shaking,” she said, recalling that some passengers across the aisle had noticed “a little piece fell off” the wing.

"Mr. Bennet, who will be able to keep his Senate seat as he pursues the governor’s mansion, is the latest Democratic senator to seek to move on from Congress.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Mr. Bennet, who will be able to keep his Senate seat as he pursues the governor’s mansion, is the latest Democratic senator to seek to move on from Congress. By Lisa Lerer Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, is planning to announce on Friday that he will run for governor next year, according to two people with knowledge of his preparations. The move by Mr. Bennet, who has served in the Senate since 2009 and ran for president in 2020, makes him the latest Democratic senator to plan to move on from Congress. He is not up for re-election in the Senate until 2028, meaning he can keep his seat as he pursues the governor’s mansion. Axios earlier reported Mr. Bennet’s planned move. Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat who has led the state since 2019, cannot run for re-election because of term limits. Colorado, once a political battleground, has not elected a Republican governor since 2002, making Mr. Bennet a strong contender to be the next chief executive of the state. But first, he will face Phil Weiser, the state’s Democratic attorney general, who has already announced a bid. Mr. Weiser has emerged as a high-profile opponent of the Trump administration, joining with other state attorneys general to file lawsuits over a series of policies and executive orders. With Mr. Bennet’s national brand and strong fund-raising ability, he is likely to become the front-runner in the governor’s race. His entrance is also likely to dissuade other possible Democratic candidates from jumping into the contest. A former Denver Public Schools superintendent, Mr. Bennet was appointed to the Senate in 2009, and has won re-election three times. He ran as a moderate candidate in his party’s crowded 2020 presidential primary race, but his campaign failed to catch fire and he did not qualify for most of the debates.

"Observers of her political rise — and some who have sparred with her — say Gov. Janet Mills’s refusal to bow to President Trump is right in character.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Observers of her political rise — and some who have sparred with her — say Gov. Janet Mills’s refusal to bow to President Trump is right in character. By Jenna Russell Reporting from Farmington, Maine President Trump and Gov. Janet Mills of Maine have history. When he visited the state early in the pandemic, he insulted her public health policies and called her “a dictator” who “doesn’t know what she’s doing.” The governor, a Democrat and brusque former prosecutor, did not mince words in response: “I have spent the better part of my career listening to loud men talk tough to disguise their weakness,” she said at the time. It seems likely, given Mr. Trump’s long memory for slights, that he had not forgotten her appraisal in February when he tossed out a seemingly offhand question in a White House meeting with governors: “Is Maine here?” The ensuing clash between the two leaders, over a Maine anti-discrimination law that allows transgender athletes to participate in girls’ and women’s sports, has escalated steadily since then. After Mr. Trump threatened that day to cut off funding for Maine, and Ms. Mills shot back, “See you in court,” she has not budged from her stance: that complying with the president’s executive order barring transgender women from women’s sports would violate the Maine law. While she has stood firm, the federal government has barraged the state with investigations, declared its education system to be in violation of federal law and frozen some of its funding. The Department of Education has set Friday as a final deadline for Maine to comply with the president’s order. If it does not, the agency plans to hand the matter over to the Department of Justice for enforcement. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Four or five firms could soon agree to deals that would be unveiled as a package, in an escalation of the president’s crackdown on an industry that has drawn his ire.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Four or five firms could soon agree to deals that would be unveiled as a package, in an escalation of the president’s crackdown on an industry that has drawn his ire. By Ben ProtessMaggie Haberman and Michael S. Schmidt President Trump is planning to announce new deals with several of the nation’s top law firms requiring them to offer legal support for some of his favored causes, according to people with knowledge of the matter. In a cabinet meeting on Thursday, Mr. Trump said four or five firms, which he did not name, would reach deals with the administration, each committing to do $125 million worth of legal work on issues he supports. That amount would eclipse the amount of pro bono work other firms agreed to provide under earlier agreements. Unlike earlier deals that Mr. Trump announced one at a time — each drawing condemnation within the firms and across the legal world — the president is expected to unveil several deals together as one collective concession from the industry, the people said. They, like others in this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the private negotiations. While it is unclear which firms are next, Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett have all had discussions with Mr. Trump’s advisers in recent days, the people with knowledge of the matter said. Those firms, all top 20 firms by revenue, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Trump’s push for the latest flurry of agreements represents an escalation of his crackdown on an industry that has drawn his ire for its role in seeking to hold him and his allies to account or opposing him politically. Mr. Trump started going after firms last month by issuing financially punitive executive orders. Although judges have found that the orders are likely unconstitutional, Mr. Trump has continued to impose them on some firms, while his advisers strike deals with other firms that agree to donate time for issues like combating antisemitism.

By Maggie Haberman and Ana Swanson Reporting from Washington A day after President Trump capitulated on his global reciprocal tariffs, he and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted that one country after another was coming to them to make deals to avoid further economic pain. But the devil is in the details, and Mr. Trump and Mr. Lutnick offered very few. Instead, they said that things would work out, without saying much more. “Everybody wants to come and make a deal, and we’re working with a lot of different countries, and it’s all going to work out very well,” Mr. Trump said during a cabinet meeting. “I think it’s going to work out really, very well, but we’re in good shape.” Mr. Lutnick chimed in: “We have so many countries to talk to. They have come with offers that they never, ever, ever would have come with but for the moves that the president has made demanding that people treat the United States with respect.” But exactly which countries might strike a deal, and over what, remains unclear. For the most part, the deals that the Trump administration negotiates are unlikely to be comprehensive trade agreements, which can take years to broker and require congressional approval. More limited deals may benefit some exporters, but not ultimately do much to help the U.S. economy or diminish the U.S. trade deficit, which Mr. Trump has targeted. Manufacturing, tech and retail business groups in Washington said Wednesday that they had heard no indications of deals coming together yet. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Musk said his group was on pace to cut $150 billion from the federal budget in one budget year. That would be a sharp drop from his previous stated goal of $1 trillion.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Musk said his group was on pace to cut $150 billion from the federal budget in one budget year. That would be a sharp drop from his previous stated goal of $1 trillion. By David A. Fahrenthold and Maggie Haberman Reporting from Washington While stumping for Donald J. Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign, Elon Musk said he could cut $2 trillion from the federal budget. After Mr. Trump took office and placed Mr. Musk in charge of the budget-slashing so-called Department of Government Efficiency, Mr. Musk lowered that projection by half, to $1 trillion in the upcoming fiscal year. In a cabinet meeting on Thursday, Mr. Musk appeared to set his group’s goal lower still. “I’m excited to announce that we anticipate savings in ’26 from reduction of waste and fraud by $150 billion,” Mr. Musk told Mr. Trump, referring to the fiscal year, which runs from the beginning of October 2025 to the end of September 2026. Mr. Musk’s group has slashed budgets and fired thousands of workers around Washington, but so far the DOGE website indicates that it remains far from reaching his goal of $1 trillion in savings next year. As of Thursday, the site claimed $150 billion in savings, with an itemized list of some of the purported cuts. It was unclear if Mr. Musk meant to say that the $150 billion was merely what his team had found so far — meaning that $1 trillion in savings was still possible — or if that $150 billion was all it expected to find. A White House official said $1 trillion in savings remained “the goal.” Unlike a previous cabinet meeting, during which Mr. Trump had Mr. Musk speak at the outset, Thursday’s meeting began with the president asking Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to speak. Mr. Musk spoke later, and briefly. In his remarks, Mr. Musk said that he answered someone who asked how he finds fraud in government by saying, “Actually, just go in any direction — that’s how you find it.” He described it as a “target-rich environment.” But the website that Mr. Musk’s group has used to tout its savings has been plagued by errors, including triple-counting the same cancellations and claiming credit for cutting programs that ended under President George W. Bush. Mr. Musk’s critics outside the administration — including Stephen K. Bannon, the far-right provocateur and former senior Trump White House official — have said publicly that the cost-cutting effort is directionally correct, but that Mr. Musk is unlikely to achieve $1 trillion in cuts.

By Charlie SavageMaggie HabermanJonathan Swan and Michael S. Schmidt Charlie Savage, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan reported from Washington, and Michael S. Schmidt from New York. President Trump’s first-term efforts to spur law enforcement officials to pursue his political enemies were haphazard, informal and often hashed out in private. Now, his demands for investigations are starting to become more formalized through written presidential decrees as he seeks to use the power of public office to punish people and companies he has cast as enemies and silence potential critics. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump crossed a new line. Flanked by senior aides and cabinet secretaries, the president signed presidential memos that singled out two officials from his first term who had either defied or simply contradicted him. In a clear escalation, he directed the government to examine their actions for any criminal wrongdoing. The president signed a third order, his most recent attack on law firms for taking clients or hiring former officials he did not like, this time targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey. The firm has led successful defamation suits against news outlets that spread Mr. Trump’s election lies, including a $787.5 million settlement paid by Fox News. Taken together, the memos send a stark message: To oppose Mr. Trump will mean risking punishment at the hands of the federal government. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"A trial judge had ordered the Trump administration to take steps to return the migrant, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, from a notorious prison in El Salvador.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by A trial judge had ordered the Trump administration to take steps to return the migrant, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, from a notorious prison in El Salvador. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court on Thursday instructed the government to take steps to return a Salvadoran migrant it had wrongly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador. In an unsigned order, the court stopped short of ordering the return of the migrant, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, indicating that courts may not have the power to require the executive branch to do so. But the court endorsed part of a trial judge’s order that had required the government to “facilitate and effectuate the return” of Mr. Abrego Garcia. “The order properly requires the government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador,” the Supreme Court’s ruling said. “The intended scope of the term ‘effectuate’ in the district court’s order is, however, unclear, and may exceed the district court’s authority.” The case will now return to the trial court, and it is not clear whether and when Mr. Abrego Garcia will be returned to the United States. “The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,” the Supreme Court’s ruling said. “For its part, the government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Prosecutors filed felony charges on Thursday against 12 protesters, nearly all with ties to Stanford University, for breaking into an administration building and occupying it in 2024.",2025-04-10,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Prosecutors filed felony charges on Thursday against 12 protesters, nearly all with ties to Stanford University, for breaking into an administration building and occupying it in 2024. By Heather Knight and Isabelle Taft Heather Knight reported from San Francisco, and Isabelle Taft from New York. Prosecutors on Thursday filed felony charges against 12 pro-Palestinian protesters — all but one of them a current or former student at Stanford University — for breaking into administration offices in June and causing extensive damage. The charges were among the most severe levied against participants in last year’s pro-Palestinian demonstrations on college campuses. More than 3,000 people were arrested at college protests and encampments in the spring of 2024, but they generally faced misdemeanor charges or saw their charges dropped. Jeff Rosen, the district attorney for Santa Clara County, which includes the Stanford campus, charged the 12 protesters with felony vandalism and felony conspiracy to trespass. They face up to three years and eight months in prison, as well as the payment of restitution to reimburse the university for the damage. Stanford is one of dozens of schools being investigated by the Trump administration for how they have handled pro-Palestinian protests and whether they have done enough to combat antisemitism on campus. The administration has also revoked the visas of several Stanford students and recent graduates, though the reason is unclear. Mr. Rosen said that President Trump’s intense focus on Stanford and other universities played no role in the decision to charge the crimes as felonies. “What the federal administration is doing is what they’re doing. What I’m doing is applying the California Penal Code,” Mr. Rosen said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"President Trump on Thursday cited the growing water debt that Mexico owes the United States under a treaty governing the use of the countries’ shared rivers.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by President Trump on Thursday cited the growing water debt that Mexico owes the United States under a treaty governing the use of the countries’ shared rivers. By Chris Cameron and Emiliano Rodríguez Mega Chris Cameron reported from Washington and Emiliano Rodríguez Mega from Mexico City. President Trump on Thursday threatened additional tariffs and other sanctions against Mexico over a long-running water dispute in a potential escalation of tensions with one of America’s biggest trading partners. In a social media post, Mr. Trump accused Mexico of failing to provide 1.3 million acre-feet of water — or more than 420 billion gallons — under a 1944 treaty mediating the distribution of water from three rivers, the Rio Grande, the Colorado and the Tijuana. “Mexico has been stealing the water from Texas farmers,” Mr. Trump said, adding that “we will keep escalating consequences, including TARIFFS and, maybe even SANCTIONS, until Mexico honors the Treaty, and GIVES TEXAS THE WATER THEY ARE OWED!” Responding to Mr. Trump’s post, Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, acknowledged that her country had fallen short of its treaty commitments, saying that a yearslong drought had significantly hindered its ability to provide the full amount of water the agreement called for. She said that her government had sent “a comprehensive proposal” to U.S. diplomats to deliver water to Texas and find a solution satisfactory to both countries. “To the extent of water availability, Mexico has been complying,” she wrote on social media. “I am sure that, as in other matters, an agreement will be reached.” Mexico has struck a conciliatory tone in negotiations with the Trump administration, prioritizing dialogue over threats and a cool-headed approach over retaliatory measures. The strategy seems to have earned Ms. Sheinbaum some respect from Mr. Trump, who earlier on Thursday called her “a terrific person” and “a fantastic woman.” There have been longstanding tensions over water between Mexico and the United States. In 2020, those tensions exploded into violence, with Mexican farmers seizing control of a dam in the border region in an effort to shut off water deliveries to the United States. Rising temperatures and long droughts have made water more scarce, making the water from rivers Mexico and the United States share all the more valuable. According to data provided by the International Boundary and Water Commission, which mediates water disputes between the two countries, Mexico has fallen well short of its treaty commitments on water delivery in the last five years. Between October 2020 and October 2024, Mexico provided just over 400,000 acre-feet of water, far less than the roughly 1.4 million acre-feet called for under treaty stipulations. The debt has only grown since. Chris Cameron is a Times reporter covering Washington, focusing on breaking news and the Trump administration.

Austin III, started the roughly 50-nation group to support Kyiv after Russia invaded in 2022, but he has given up leadership.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Russia-Ukraine War Advertisement Supported by Pete Hegseth’s predecessor as defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, started the roughly 50-nation group to support Kyiv after Russia invaded in 2022, but he has given up leadership. By John Ismay Reporting from Washington When military leaders from roughly 50 nations met in Brussels on Friday to discuss aid shipments to Kyiv, one was noticeably absent: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Instead of attending the gathering, the 27th meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, in person, Mr. Hegseth dialed in and participated virtually. It was the first time since the group’s creation three years ago that the Pentagon’s top civilian was not physically present for an in-person meeting of the group, as the Trump administration treats Ukraine less like a partner and moves closer to Russia. President Trump promised on the campaign trail to settle the war between Russia and Ukraine even before he was sworn in, and said that he could do it within 24 hours. But cease-fire negotiations with Washington, Kyiv and Moscow have failed to yield an end to fighting that has led to the deaths of an estimated 100,000 Ukrainian and 150,000 Russian soldiers. U.S. leadership of the contact group had provided a lifeline of arms and matériel for Ukraine’s armed forces, but the flow of goods has largely petered out since Mr. Trump’s second inauguration. Ukraine particularly needs air-defense munitions, such as the Patriot missiles the United States previously shipped. That was brought into sharp focus last week when a Russian missile attack in central Ukraine struck near a playground, killing 19 civilians, including nine children.

"The actor, who plans to return to his role on the hit show “Euphoria,” told People magazine about his diagnosis.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The actor, who plans to return to his role on the hit show “Euphoria,” told People magazine about his diagnosis. By Hank Sanders Eric Dane, the actor known as the handsome plastic surgeon nicknamed McSteamy in “Grey’s Anatomy,” told People magazine that he has been diagnosed with A.L.S. Mr. Dane told the magazine that he was grateful for his family’s support and was excited to return soon to the set of “Euphoria.” His representatives did not immediately respond to emails and phone calls seeking additional information. A.L.S., also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a neurological disorder that degrades a patient’s ability to control muscles, speak and eventually breathe without assistance. While A.L.S. patients often die within five years of being diagnosed, clinical trials for potential therapies have generated hope about extending a patient’s life by several months. Mr. Dane began acting in the early 1990s with small parts in television shows, first in “Saved By the Bell” and later in “Married With Children.” Over the years, his charm and boyish good looks earned him recurring roles on “Gideon’s Crossing,” where he played a doctor, and on “Charmed.” His breakout moment came in 2006 in another medical role, this time as a leading man in “Grey’s Anatomy,” which was renewed for a 22nd season this year, making it one of the most successful televisions shows of all time. Donning a white lab coat and sporting a well-kept beard and perfectly messy hair, Mr. Dane portrayed Dr. Mark Sloan, the head of plastic surgery at the Seattle hospital where the show was based. The hospital was later renamed after his character, who died on the show. Mr. Dane’s most prominent role recently has been on the television show “Euphoria,” where he portrays the father of Nate Jacobs, played by Jacob Elordi. Although he usually plays a handsome supporting character, he has played a range of roles that deviated from that, including as a hired killer in the movie “Bad Boys: Ride or Die.” “Television is the land of pretty people,” Lynn Hirschberg wrote for The New York Times in 2009. The article went on to quote George Clooney, another handsome man, as he waxed poetic about Mr. Dane. “He’s good-looking, and he has a sense of humor. That’s rare,” Mr. Clooney said. Hank Sanders is a Times reporter and a member of the 2024-25 Times Fellowship class, a program for journalists early in their careers.

"Lt. Gen. Dan Caine will serve as the senior military adviser to President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Lt. Gen. Dan Caine will serve as the senior military adviser to President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. By Helene Cooper Reporting from Washington The Senate confirmed early Friday Lt. Gen. Dan Caine, the former National Guardsman and fighter pilot, to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Caine is replacing another Air Force fighter pilot, Gen. Charles Brown, known as C.Q., whom President Trump abruptly fired in February. The Senate’s lopsided 60-25 vote approving General Caine, who is retired, was expected. While Democrats had expressed concerns about the rash of firings at the Pentagon in Mr. Trump’s second term, General Caine garnered little opposition because the majority of them appeared to view him as perhaps the best possible option, given the circumstances. In his new role, as the senior military adviser to Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, General Caine will take over a Joint Staff that has been somewhat isolated from national security decision making in the last two months. The first challenge facing him will be whether he will manage to wield any influence. Mr. Trump’s national security team has embarked on a series of early moves, including by expanding a bombing campaign meant to rein in Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen and considering whether, and how, the United States will continue military assistance to Ukraine for the war with Russia. General Caine’s confirmation came with none of the drama that accompanied that of Mr. Hegseth, who, amid a flurry of questions about his qualifications, needed Vice President JD Vance to cast the deciding vote. Throughout General Caine’s hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on April 1, Democrats appeared to be torn. They wanted him to say plainly that he would push back against some of Mr. Hegseth’s initiatives targeting ethnic minorities, women and other groups. But they did not want to push so hard that they irreparably harmed his relationships with Mr. Hegseth and Mr. Trump before he even took office. “I expect you to pledge to always provide your best military advice to the president and the secretary of defense,” said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the committee. “Even if that advice is not what they would want to hear.” General Caine, for his part, promised he would give the president and Mr. Hegseth his best military advice and pledged to “speak truth to power.” On Wednesday, Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican who chairs the Armed Services Committee, called on the Senate to remain in session as long as necessary to approve General Caine. “The Chinese Communist Party continues an expansive military buildup, and our adversaries continue to band together against the United States,” Mr. Wicker said in a statement. “It is critical that the Senate confirm Lt. Gen. Caine as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff this week.” Eric Schmitt contributed reporting. Helene Cooper is a Pentagon correspondent. She was previously an editor, diplomatic correspondent and White House correspondent.

Lyle, left, and Erik Menendez leave courtroom in Santa Monica, Calif., in 1990.Credit...Nick Ut/Associated Press Supported by By Tim Arango and Matt Stevens Tim Arango and Matt Stevens reported from Los Angeles. They have been covering different aspects of the Menendez brothers’ case for the last two years. One day more than 20 years ago, Anerae Brown sat down in the day room of a California prison across from Lyle Menendez, who was in front of a chessboard, playing both sides. It was Lyle’s regular table, where he could be found most days checking the stock tables in The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Brown had exchanged a few words here and there with Lyle in the yard, but life in prison can be highly segregated, and until Lyle waved him over to his table that day, race and class had largely kept them apart. A rap artist and member of the Crips gang, Mr. Brown was in the first years of a long prison sentence for a gang-related murder. Lyle said he had noticed that Mr. Brown was still keeping company with gang members. “I think that you can do so much more with your influence,” he recalled Lyle saying to him. Mr. Brown was skeptical, but slowly the message began to sink in. He began participating in anger management classes and a program to assist fellow inmates who used wheelchairs. And when Mr. Brown was transferred to a different prison several years later, Lyle’s brother, Erik, was there to meet him at the gate. Lyle had written a letter to Erik about Mr. Brown that said, “Treat him as if I showed up.” Mr. Brown eventually earned early release, in part because of his work with the brothers. Now, their efforts with Mr. Brown and other men may prove instrumental in the brothers’ own bid to walk free. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Conservatives in the House say they won’t back any package without deep cuts that would all but certainly affect the health program. Some Senate Republicans say they won’t accept such cuts.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Conservatives in the House say they won’t back any package without deep cuts that would all but certainly affect the health program. Some Senate Republicans say they won’t accept such cuts. By Catie Edmondson and Michael Gold Reporting from the Capitol When Republican leaders weigh which of their members might defy the party and defect on major legislation, Senator Jerry Moran’s name rarely comes up. So it was all the more remarkable when Mr. Moran, a third-term senator from Kansas, went to the floor last week to issue a stark warning about how the budget blueprint his party was about to approve could affect his state. Noting that the budget plan that Republicans were considering could lay the groundwork for sweeping cuts to Medicaid, Mr. Moran warned that such reductions might threaten struggling rural hospitals and, by extension, the future of the rural American heartland. “I want to make certain that my colleagues know, in my view, the value of making certain we do no harm to those in desperate need of health care in Kansas and across the country,” Mr. Moran said Speaker Mike Johnson was able to put down a revolt on Thursday and push through that blueprint to deliver President Trump’s agenda of spending and tax cuts by promising House conservatives that their colleagues in the Senate would join them in cutting $1.5 trillion in federal spending over the next decade. The problem for Republicans is that it is increasingly clear that some G.O.P. senators simply do not have the appetite for the kinds of deep cuts that their counterparts in the House are agitating for. In recent days they have expressed concerns about repealing the entirety of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Inflation Reduction Act and restricting access to food stamps.

But dust-ups over his compensation, the scope of his authority and more got in the way. Steve Soboroff’s 90-day tenure as the Los Angeles mayor’s chief recovery officer came to an end on Friday.Credit...Philip Cheung for The New York Times Supported by By Shawn Hubler and Adam Nagourney Shawn Hubler and Adam Nagourney are longtime California correspondents, covering state politics, government and culture. Hubler has reported on the last six Los Angeles mayors. Three months ago, Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles appointed Steve Soboroff to oversee the first phase of the huge recovery effort that confronted the city after the January wildfires. “There is no one better equipped to create our rebuilding plan,” she said at the time. Mr. Soboroff, 76, a developer and longtime civic leader, had known Ms. Bass, 71, for decades. They had worked together on initiatives from school bonds to the recovery from the Northridge earthquake. For 36 years, until 2018, he had lived in Pacific Palisades, one of the hardest-hit fire zones. She had spoken highly of him in 2001, when he ran unsuccessfully for mayor, and he had been a chairman of her 2022 mayoral campaign. But Mr. Soboroff’s 90-day tenure as the mayor’s chief recovery officer came to an end on Friday, clouded by a sharp deterioration in his relationship with Ms. Bass and his influence at City Hall. There were clashes with her administration over the scope of his authority, his compensation and the extent to which the Palisades should reopen to the public. Mr. Soboroff made clear in an interview that he was leaving unhappily and reluctantly. His argument that he should stay in the post for two years was rejected by Ms. Bass and her aides from the outset, he said, and as their divisions deepened, even another 90-day stint seemed unfeasible. A low point, he said, was when he learned City Hall had started a search for his successor without alerting him. “How they thought that I wouldn’t find out about it — this is my town right here,” he said over breakfast at a deli in West Los Angeles. “I was the starting pitcher in an all-star game. Would I have liked to have pitched longer and won the game? Yeah. But nobody pitches more than three innings in an all-star game.” Asked about Mr. Soboroff’s tenure, Zach Seidl, a spokesman for the mayor, said in a statement that “at times he sent confusing messages to residents but we are grateful for his service and contributions.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But across Mr. Trump’s political career, his case for tariffs has remained consistent, relying on a number of false and misleading claims to describe a global trade system that is “unfair” to the United States. Although Mr. Trump abruptly announced on Wednesday that he would pause steep reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, a 10 percent “base line” tariff remains in place for most imports. Here’s a guide to some of his most cited claims: What Was Said This lacks evidence. Mr. Trump imposed a 10 percent tariff on nearly all imports from most of the world, except for Canada and Mexico, that went into effect on April 5.

"Steve Sisolak, the former governor of Nevada, says he is weighing a rematch against Gov. Joe Lombardo, the Republican who ousted him in 2022.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Steve Sisolak, the former governor of Nevada, says he is weighing a rematch against Gov. Joe Lombardo, the Republican who ousted him in 2022. By Kellen Browning Kellen Browning covers politics in the Western United States. Many Democrats performed better than expected in the 2022 midterm elections, bucking historical trends to hold on to key governor’s offices and House seats and to expand their majority in the Senate. One notable exception was Gov. Steve Sisolak of Nevada, who was weighed down by a backlash to the lockdowns he had ordered during the coronavirus pandemic and by the economic downturn that followed. Even as Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat, squeaked out a re-election victory in Nevada, Mr. Sisolak became the only Democratic governor to lose that year, giving way to Joe Lombardo, a Republican. Now, as Democrats search for a direction after their November defeat and contemplate the best ways to oppose President Trump and his allies, Mr. Sisolak is considering a rematch against Mr. Lombardo. A former Clark County sheriff, Mr. Lombardo has stood as a Republican bulwark against the Democratic-controlled Nevada Legislature. He is up for re-election next year. Mr. Lombardo occupies a somewhat rare position in today’s Republican Party. Though he speaks favorably of the president, he distanced himself last year from the state party and its focus on debunked election conspiracy theories, and he was not an especially vocal presence on the campaign trail for Mr. Trump. In two phone calls this week, Mr. Sisolak, 71, spoke about a possible comeback attempt, the state of the Democratic Party and how the economic turmoil caused by Mr. Trump’s tariffs could affect Nevadans. Here is the conversation, condensed and edited. What have you been seeing in Nevada since you’ve been out of office, and how do you think Governor Lombardo has been doing?

"The Trump administration clashed with a federal judge, refusing to comply with her demand for a road map to release a Maryland man it inadvertently deported to a Salvadoran prison last month.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Trump administration clashed with a federal judge, refusing to comply with her demand for a road map to release a Maryland man it inadvertently deported to a Salvadoran prison last month. By Alan Feuer and Aishvarya Kavi Alan Feuer reported from New York, and Aishvarya Kavi from Greenbelt, Md. The Trump administration on Friday continued to pursue its stubborn fight against securing the freedom of a Maryland man it inadvertently deported to a Salvadoran prison last month despite a court order that expressly said he could remain in the United States. Taking an increasingly combative stance, the administration defied a federal judge’s order to provide a written road map of its plans to free the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. Trump officials then repeatedly stonewalled her efforts to get the most basic information about him at a court hearing. During the hearing, in Federal District Court in Maryland, the judge, Paula Xinis, called the administration’s evasions “extremely troubling” and demanded that the Justice Department provide her with daily updates on the White House’s progress in getting Mr. Abrego Garcia back on U.S. soil. “The court finds that the defendants have failed to comply with this court’s order,” Judge Xinis wrote in a ruling Friday afternoon. The conflict between the judge and the White House arose just one day after the Supreme Court unanimously ordered the administration to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release from Salvadoran custody and only a few days before President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador was set to arrive in Washington for an official visit. Asked about the case on Friday, President Trump appeared in no hurry to take steps to ensure Mr. Abrego Garcia’s return, despite repeated court orders and a Supreme Court intervention.

By Remy Tumin Three people were killed when a small plane crashed near the airport in Boca Raton, Fla., on Friday, officials said, sending large plumes of smoke billowing into the air as residents reported hearing a thunderous crashing sound. The three people who died were all on board the Cessna plane when it crashed just after 10 a.m., said Michael LaSalle, an assistant chief and public information officer with the Boca Raton Fire Rescue. A fourth person on the ground was treated for non-life threatening injuries after he drove through the “fireball” from the crash and hit a tree, Chief LaSalle said. The plane’s pilot reported “mechanical issues” just before the crash, he said. Footage from television news showed debris on a set of train tracks beneath a highway overpass. The Boca Raton police said a major section of Interstate 95 had been closed near the crash site. Flightradar24, a flight tracking site, captured a dizzying flight pattern as the plane looped and zigzagged around the Boca Raton area. It took off around 10:15 a.m. local time from Boca Raton Airport and was headed to Tallahassee, Fla., according to the site. The plane, a Cessna 310R built in 1977, was registered to a limited liability company in Delaware, according to a Federal Aviation Administration database. That model seats four to six people.

"The veto by Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, a Democrat, pushed back on a growing campaign against the mineral, which has been used for decades to prevent cavities.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The veto by Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, a Democrat, pushed back on a growing campaign against the mineral, which has been used for decades to prevent cavities. By Emily Cochrane The mayor of Miami-Dade County on Friday said she vetoed legislation that would remove fluoride from the drinking water in Florida’s most populous county, pushing back on a growing campaign against the mineral used to prevent cavities. The veto by Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, a Democrat, comes at a moment when critics of adding fluoride to the water supply have a newly powerful ally: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump’s health secretary, who this week called for states to ban fluoride in drinking water. Utah recently became the first state to outlaw adding fluoride to public water, and several other states, including Florida, are considering similar action. “The science is very clear,” Ms. Levine Cava said at a news conference on Friday. She added, “ending fluoridation could have real and lasting harm, especially for children and families who cannot afford regular dental care.” The Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners, a nonpartisan body, approved the measure to ban fluoride on April 1 in an 8 to 2 vote, with three commissioners absent. Nine votes are needed to override the mayor’s veto if all 13 commissioners are present, and it is unclear whether there will be enough support. The next scheduled board meeting is on May 6. Six commissioners are Republican, including Kevin Marino Cabrera, an ally of Mr. Trump’s who will soon depart to become the country’s ambassador to Panama. Ms. Levine Cava is now the state’s highest-ranking elected Democrat, with Republicans having swept every other countywide elected office in Miami-Dade — including sheriff and elections supervisor — last year. At the news conference on Friday, Ms. Levine Cava, flanked by dentists and doctors in their white medical coats, cited research supporting her decision.

"The president has often been guarded about even the most basic information about his health. “Overall, I felt I was in very good shape,” Mr. Trump said.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The president has often been guarded about even the most basic information about his health. “Overall, I felt I was in very good shape,” Mr. Trump said. By Maggie Haberman President Trump, the oldest man to be inaugurated as president, visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a physical on Friday, the first of his new administration and one that he said included cardiology and cognitive tests. Mr. Trump, 78, said on Friday evening that the results would be released on Sunday. “I don’t know what to tell you other than I got every answer right,” he said. “Overall, I felt I was in very good shape,” Mr. Trump said. “Good heart. A good soul. Very good soul.” He then mocked his immediate predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose mental acuity he has long attacked, saying he “wanted to be a little different than Biden.” The physical could offer the first glimpse of the health of Mr. Trump, who has often been guarded about even the most basic medical information since he was shot in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in July. He has long been phobic about germs and disease. According to many of his former presidential and business aides, Mr. Trump has tried to avoid ever appearing sick. In 2015, his personal physician at the time, Dr. Harold Bornstein, wrote in a note to the news media that Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, had “extraordinary” strength and stamina. Dr. Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that Mr. Trump had personally dictated the letter. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"The move by Ms. Reynolds, a Republican, will shake up the leadership of a state that has transformed from a political battleground into safely red territory.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The move by Ms. Reynolds, a Republican, will shake up the leadership of a state that has transformed from a political battleground into safely red territory. By Shane Goldmacher Kim Reynolds, the Republican governor of Iowa, announced on Friday that she would not seek re-election in 2026, setting up the first open race for the state’s top office in years. Ms. Reynolds, 65, has served as governor since 2017 and was lieutenant governor before that. She has overseen the transformation of a state that was once a battleground carried by former President Barack Obama into a Republican stronghold. “This wasn’t an easy decision because I love this state and I love serving you,” she said in a video announcing her decision to step aside. Ms. Reynolds is the first woman to serve as governor of Iowa. She succeeded Terry Branstad, a Republican who led the state over two long stretches in the 1980s, 1990s and 2010s before resigning in 2017 to become President Trump’s ambassador to China. Ms. Reynolds governed as a fiscal conservative, cutting income tax rates in the state to a flat 3.8 percent as of this year. In the 2024 presidential race, she endorsed Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida before the Iowa caucuses and campaigned aggressively with him, earning the ire of Mr. Trump. By contrast, Mr. Trump heaped praise on the state’s Republican attorney general, Brenna Bird, who had endorsed him. Ms. Bird said in a statement on Friday that she had already received “calls of encouragement” and that she and her husband would “pray and consider what this decision means for our future.” Chris LaCivita, a top Trump strategist on the 2024 campaign, appeared to be among those encouraging her candidacy. “Run!!!!!!” he wrote on X, linking to an old article in which she endorsed Mr. Trump’s campaign. Another key Trump ally from Iowa is Matt Whitaker, his new ambassador to NATO. Mr. Whitaker served in the Justice Department in Mr. Trump’s first term, including as acting attorney general. By late 2024, Ms. Reynolds’s job approval rating in the Iowa Poll, the state’s top survey, had dipped to its lowest level on record, 45 percent. Iowa continues to be the first state in the Republican presidential nominating calendar, giving its governor outsize sway in national politics. The decision for Ms. Reynolds to retire will shake up the leadership of a state that has been remarkably stable. Senator Charles E. Grassley, 91, has served in the Senate since 1981, and his Republican counterpart, Senator Joni Ernst, is up for re-election in 2026. Iowa’s delegation in the House is now made up of four Republicans, three of whom represent districts seen as potential battlegrounds. One of them, Representative Ashley Hinson, praised Ms. Reynolds on X minutes after the video was released. “The next governor no doubt has big shoes to fill,” she wrote. Another, Representative Randy Feenstra, who represents the state’s solidly conservative northwestern corner, “will continue to consider how he can best serve Iowa and deliver results,” according to his spokesman, Billy Fuerst. The state auditor, Rob Sand, is widely seen as a likely Democratic candidate for governor. Shane Goldmacher is a Times national political correspondent.

Gone is “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” Maya Angelou’s transformative best-selling 1970 memoir chronicling her struggles with racism and trauma. Two copies of “Mein Kampf” by Adolf Hitler are still on the shelves. Gone is “Memorializing the Holocaust,” Janet Jacobs’s 2010 examination of how female victims of the Holocaust have been portrayed and remembered. “The Camp of the Saints” by Jean Raspail is still on the shelves. The 1973 novel, which envisions a takeover of the Western world by immigrants from developing countries, has been embraced by white supremacists and promoted by Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser. “The Bell Curve,” which argues that Black men and women are genetically less intelligent than white people, is still there. But a critique of the book was pulled. The Trump administration’s decision to order the banning of certain books from the U.S. Naval Academy’s library is a case study in ideological censorship, alumni and academics say. Political appointees in the Department of the Navy’s leadership decided which books to remove. A look at the list showed that antiracists were targeted, laying bare the contradictions in the assault on so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

"The Justice Department said in a filing Friday that the academy changed its policy to adhere to an executive order issued in January by President Trump.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Justice Department said in a filing Friday that the academy changed its policy to adhere to an executive order issued in January by President Trump. By Karoun Demirjian The Air Force Academy has stopped taking the race, gender or ethnicity of applicants into consideration, the Justice Department stated in a filing Friday responding to a lawsuit that accused the institution of discrimination for making class diversity a factor in its admissions process. In the filing, Justice Department lawyers said that Gwendolyn R. DeFilippi, acting assistant secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, issued a memorandum in early February eliminating “quotas, objectives, and goals based on sex, race or ethnicity for organizational composition, academic admission, career fields, or class composition” from its admissions considerations. The Air Force Academy, in Colorado, is the second military academy to adopt such a change to how it reviews applications. Last month, in a similar filing, the Justice Department stated that the Naval Academy’s superintendent, Vice Adm. Yvette M. Davids, had issued similar guidance in February dictating that “neither race, ethnicity, nor sex can be considered as a factor for admission at any point during the admissions process, including qualification and acceptance.” Both filings sought to postpone hearings in their respective court cases while the policies took effect and offered to provide the court with status updates after 60 days. The changes were first reported by Reuters. Justice Department lawyers explained in the filings that the changes were carried out to adhere to a Jan. 27 executive order in which President Trump said that “every element of the Armed Forces should operate free from any preference based on race or sex.” Both lawsuits were filed before Mr. Trump took office. The filings also refer to a Jan. 29 memorandum issued by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth which, using an abbreviation for the Department of Defense, ordered that “no DoD Component will establish sex-based, race-based, or ethnicity-based goals for organizational composition, academic admission, or career fields.” Karoun Demirjian is a breaking news reporter for the The Times.

"It was the latest in a series of moves to scrap or soften punishments against President Trump’s supporters, including members of the violent mob that attacked the Capitol.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by It was the latest in a series of moves to scrap or soften punishments against President Trump’s supporters, including members of the violent mob that attacked the Capitol. By Glenn Thrush and Devlin Barrett Reporting from Washington The Justice Department, in an abrupt reversal, asked a federal judge late Thursday to release a former F.B.I. informant from prison pending appeal of his conviction on charges that he peddled misleading claims seized on by Trump allies to falsely accuse the Biden family of taking bribes. A federal prosecutor in California filed the request, under orders from senior Justice Department officials in Washington, according to officials familiar with the situation. It is the latest in a series of moves to scrap or soften punishments against President Trump’s supporters, including members of the violent mob that attacked the Capitol. The former informant, Alexander Smirnov, a shadowy fixer whose debunked claims were once promoted by the F.B.I. director, Kash Patel, agreed in December to a six-year sentence. He admitted that he had fabricated a claim that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter were each paid a $5 million bribe by a Ukrainian oligarch. The Smirnov case was an offshoot of the federal investigation into Hunter Biden, and the plea deal was negotiated by David C. Weiss, the special counsel leading the inquiry, who stepped down in January. The prosecutors who conducted the investigation officially withdrew from the case on the day the motion was filed, court documents showed. Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department had argued against the release of Mr. Smirnov, who was arrested at the Las Vegas airport after returning to the United States from overseas. In May 2024, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit backed the department in rejecting Mr. Smirnov’s request to be released from pretrial custody, deeming him a flight risk with connections overseas who might help him evade capture.

"More than 10,000 people will be put on track for deportation in May and June as a result of the Department of Homeland Security’s action.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by More than 10,000 people will be put on track for deportation in May and June as a result of the Department of Homeland Security’s action. By Hamed Aleaziz Reporting from Washington The Trump administration will end temporary protections for more than 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon, putting them on track for deportation in May and June, Department of Homeland Security officials said on Friday. Many of the Afghans affected by the decision had been allowed into the United States after the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from their country in 2021. Now, the Trump administration could send them back to a country under Taliban rule. The Afghans and Cameroonians had been living in the United States legally under Temporary Protected Status, which is meant to shield migrants from being returned to countries facing conflict or natural disasters. People who have the protected status are also allowed to work in the United States. The Trump administration has targeted T.P.S. as part of its broad crackdown on immigration. Trump officials say the program is being used improperly, to allow people to stay in the United States indefinitely. Already this year, the administration has tried to cut off Venezuelans from T.P.S. and shortened the time that Haitians can have the protections.

"The ruling cast doubt on claims by a coalition of Christian and Jewish groups that their congregations were at heightened risk of becoming targets for raids under the Trump administration.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The ruling cast doubt on claims by a coalition of Christian and Jewish groups that their congregations were at heightened risk of becoming targets for raids under the Trump administration. By Zach Montague Reporting from Washington A federal judge on Friday declined to block the Trump administration from carrying out detention and deportation operations in houses of worship, finding that a coalition of more than two dozen religious organizations had not made a clear case that their spaces and congregants had become common targets. The ruling stemmed from a lack of clarity about how President Trump’s promised mass deportation campaign has been carried out in practice since he took office. While the prospect of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents sweeping through churches, mosques and synagogues in search of undocumented congregants immediately raised alarms in religious communities, Judge Dabney L. Friedrich of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia said there were few signs, so far, that was happening. “Absent evidence of specific directives to immigration officers to target plaintiffs’ places of worship, or a pattern of enforcement actions, the court finds no credible threat of imminent enforcement,” she wrote. The decision was not the final word in the case. But Judge Friedrich’s finding that the evidence was too limited to justify an initial injunction against the practice left some doubt that the groups behind the lawsuit would prevail. In 2021, Alejandro N. Mayorkas, then the homeland security secretary, issued guidance on immigration enforcement in “sensitive locations” that had the effect of broadly prohibiting agents from making arrests in schools, hospitals, parades and places of worship. With Mr. Trump in office, his administration moved quickly to undo those protections, directing the agency not to impose any “bright line rules regarding where our immigration laws are permitted to be enforced.” Religious groups filed lawsuits challenging the policy change. In a separate case, a federal judge in Maryland temporarily prohibited raids in religious buildings. That ruling was narrow, however, with the judge declining to pause the policy nationwide. In her ruling on Friday, Judge Friedrich acknowledged that there had been a handful of arrests in churches so far this year, including one at a church associated with one of the plaintiffs in the case. But she wrote that to have appropriate cause to sue, the groups needed to show stronger evidence that their buildings had been surveilled, or were being “singled out as special targets” as part of an enforcement strategy. “The current record does not establish that such enforcement actions are sufficiently likely or imminent,” she wrote.

"The number of ballots in question exceeds the slim margin by which the Democratic incumbent won, potentially leading to the November election being overturned.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The number of ballots in question exceeds the slim margin by which the Democratic incumbent won, potentially leading to the November election being overturned. By Eduardo Medina and Nick Corasaniti In the latest twist in a prolonged legal battle over a North Carolina judicial seat, the State Supreme Court ruled on Friday that thousands of voters must fix issues with their ballots or risk having them tossed. The decision partially upheld a lower-court ruling and could lead to the November election being overturned. Military and overseas voters who did not provide an ID when casting an absentee ballot — which one justice estimated to be 2,000 to 7,000 voters — will have 30 days to fix any issues, the court ruled. But the court also ruled that roughly 60,000 ballots — from voters who, through no fault of their own, had information missing in their registration — must be counted. The case, over a seat on the very same Supreme Court, has tested the boundaries of post-election litigation and drawn criticism from democracy watchdog groups, liberals and even some conservatives across the state, who worry about a dangerous precedent being set. Though the court protected the largest category of voters whose eligibility was being challenged, the number of ballots that remain in question exceeds the slim margin by which the Democratic incumbent won. The 4-to-2 decision on Friday was in response to a plea from the Democratic incumbent, Justice Allison Riggs. She had challenged a state appeals court decision last week requiring roughly 65,000 North Carolina voters to verify their eligibility within a 15-day window or have their ballots tossed. Many of the affected voters live in Democratic-leaning counties. Justice Riggs is one of two Democrats on the seven-member Supreme Court, and has recused herself from the case. Two recounts by the State Board of Elections reaffirmed that she won the November election by 734 votes, but her Republican opponent, Judge Jefferson Griffin, has contested the result. He is currently a judge on the North Carolina Court of Appeals. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"The employee was a longtime counterintelligence analyst who had worked on the F.B.I.’s investigation examining Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The employee was a longtime counterintelligence analyst who had worked on the F.B.I.’s investigation examining Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. By Adam Goldman Reporting from Washington The F.B.I. has suspended an analyst on Kash Patel’s so-called enemies list after Mr. Patel told lawmakers that the bureau under his leadership would stay out of the political fray and not punish employees for partisan reasons. Last week, the bureau placed the analyst, Brian Auten, on administrative leave, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation. The reasons for the suspension remain unclear. The F.B.I. declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Auten also declined to comment. The suspension is likely to raise questions about whether the move was retaliatory, and about how closely Mr. Patel would stick to his promise, made during his confirmation hearing in January, that the agency would rise above partisanship despite pressure from President Trump’s allies to fire employees who took part in investigations that conservatives have condemned. The suspension of Mr. Auten, who had already been disciplined and questioned in a criminal inquiry, will also likely intensify distrust of Mr. Patel among employees who have watched senior leaders forced out in recent months with no explanation. Mr. Auten worked on two major investigations that angered Mr. Trump and Mr. Patel, including the F.B.I.’s investigation into Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential election. He was also involved in analyzing the information found on Hunter Biden’s laptop, a discovery that roiled the 2020 presidential campaign. Mr. Patel has called the Russia investigation a hoax, and singled out Mr. Auten in his book, “Government Gangsters.” In the book, Mr. Patel claimed that the F.B.I. was trying to “hide and spin” what he called “the Biden family corruption” buried in the laptop, even as agents investigated the matter.

"Mikal Mahdi’s execution came about a month after the first person in state history was killed in such a manner. Before that, no person had been killed by a firing squad in the United States in 15 years.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Mikal Mahdi’s execution came about a month after the first person in state history was killed in such a manner. Before that, no person had been killed by a firing squad in the United States in 15 years. By Eduardo Medina South Carolina executed another convicted murderer by firing squad on Friday night, the second such execution in the state. The inmate, Mikal Mahdi, 41, was declared dead shortly after 6 p.m. after a firing squad shot three bullets at a target placed over his heart, the State Department of Corrections said. A judge had ordered Mr. Mahdi, who pleaded guilty in 2006 to fatally shooting an off-duty police officer in South Carolina, to choose from three methods of execution: lethal injection, electrocution or firing squad. His lawyer, David Weiss, said that Mr. Mahdi did not want to offer a public explanation for why he chose a firing squad. His execution came just a month after Brad Sigmon, who was convicted of beating his ex-girlfriend’s parents to death with a baseball bat in 2001, became the first inmate to be executed by firing squad in the state — and the first in the United States in 15 years. Mr. Sigmon had chosen to be shot on March 7 because he had concerns about South Carolina’s lethal injection process, his lawyer said. Polls show that a majority of Americans favor the death penalty, although many view firing squads as an archaic form of justice. But as lethal injection drugs have become harder to obtain, and have at times resulted in botched executions, several states have recently legalized firing squads as an execution method.

"The Trump administration has been targeting Maine since the president sparred with Gov. Janet Mills over transgender athletes at the White House in February.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Trump administration has been targeting Maine since the president sparred with Gov. Janet Mills over transgender athletes at the White House in February. By Jenna Russell and Dana Goldstein The Department of Education said on Friday that it was moving to cut off all federal funding for Maine’s public schools because the state had ignored President Trump’s executive order banning transgender athletes from girls’ sports teams. The agency also said it had asked the Justice Department to pursue “enforcement action” against Maine, which the Trump administration has been targeting since the president picked a fight with the state’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, over transgender athletes in February. The administration had set Friday as the deadline for Maine to comply; last month, after a brief investigation, it declared that the state’s education system was violating Title IX, the federal law that prevents sex discrimination. Ms. Mills has maintained that the state’s human rights law — which prohibits discrimination based on gender identity as well as religion, race and other protected characteristics — can be changed only by the Legislature, not by executive order. She has not expressed her own views on transgender athletes participating in girls’ and women’s sports publicly, though she has said it was an issue “worthy of a debate.” The Education Department said in a statement that it would “initiate an administrative proceeding to adjudicate termination” of the state’s K-12 funding, which totaled $249 million in the 2024 fiscal year.

By Carol Rosenberg Carol Rosenberg has been reporting from Guantánamo Bay since the prison opened in 2002. A military judge on Friday threw out the confession that a man accused of conspiring in the Sept. 11 attacks made to federal agents in 2007 at Guantánamo Bay, ruling the statements were the product of a campaign of torture and isolation carried out by the C.I.A. The ruling by Col. Matthew N. McCall was the latest setback to prosecutors in their long-running quest to bring the death-penalty case to trial, despite the years the five defendants had spent in secret C.I.A. prisons. Ammar al-Baluchi, 47, was so thoroughly psychologically conditioned through abuse and threats during his time at the agency’s overseas prisons, or black sites, from 2003 to 2006 that he involuntarily incriminated himself in 2007, the judge wrote in a 111-page decision. Mr. Baluchi, who is charged in the case by the name Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, is accused of sending money and providing other support to some of the hijackers who carried out the attack that killed nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001. He is the nephew of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the man accused of masterminding the attack. Mr. Mohammed and two other defendants in the case reached plea agreements with prosecutors that are now being contested in federal court. A fifth defendant was found mentally unfit to stand trial, a condition his lawyer blames on his torture at the hands of the C.I.A. Testimony derived from C.I.A. documents showed that Mr. Baluchi was routinely kept naked and beaten during his first days of agency custody in a program of “enhanced interrogation,” which was designed by two psychologists on contract to the C.I.A.

By Hank Sanders A Pennsylvania man was arrested this week after the authorities said he threatened to assassinate President Trump, Elon Musk and other government officials in comments that he posted on YouTube. Google, which owns YouTube, alerted the F.B.I. on Tuesday to the threatening comments, which were posted by someone using the username “Mr Satan,” whom the authorities later identified as Shawn Monper, of Butler, Pa., according to a criminal complaint. Mr. Monper, 32, was arrested on Wednesday and charged with four counts of influencing, impeding or retaliating against a federal official and a federal law enforcement officer. According to the court documents, Mr. Monper wrote, “im going to assassinate him myself” in the comments under a livestream of Mr. Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress on March 4. In a comment on another YouTube video on Feb. 17, according to the complaint, Mr. Monper wrote, “Nah, we just need to start killing people, Trump, Elon, all the heads of agencies Trump appointed, and anyone who stands in the way.” On Feb. 26, according to the complaint, Mr. Monper wrote that he had “bought several guns” and had been stocking up on ammunition since Mr. Trump took office for a second time, promising “to do a mass shooting.” Butler, Pa., where Mr. Monper lives, was the site of a campaign rally where Mr. Trump was injured in an assassination attempt on July 13. The complaint did not mention that episode. Mr. Monper’s lawyer did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. In addition to Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were also a target of Mr. Monper’s threats, federal prosecutors said. As the Trump administration has ramped up its deportation efforts, ICE and Department of Homeland Security agents have come under scrutiny for detaining students and legal immigrants. On Friday, an immigration judge in Louisiana found that the Trump administration could deport a Columbia University graduate and legal permanent resident, Mahmoud Khalil, for his role in pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus last year. In a statement on Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked the F.B.I. and the Butler Township police for their work on the investigation. “Rest assured that whenever and wherever threats of assassination or mass violence occur, this Department of Justice will find, arrest, and prosecute the suspect to the fullest extent of the law and seek the maximum appropriate punishment,” she said.

"As Elon Musk continues to argue that Social Security drives illegal immigration, a new effort at the agency aims to curb it.",2025-04-11,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Newsletter As Elon Musk continues to argue that Social Security drives illegal immigration, a new effort at the agency aims to curb it. By Jess Bidgood and Alexandra Berzon One hallmark of Elon Musk’s 12 weeks in government has been his focus on Social Security. He has sent one of his closest advisers to work at the Social Security Administration. He has falsely insisted that the program is rife with fraud. And he has depicted the entitlement as a tool — a “giant magnet,” to be specific — that he says entices illegal immigrants to come to the United States. That last part has turned Social Security into a major focal point of Musk’s unfounded belief that Democrats have allowed immigrants into the United States as part of a scheme to tilt the electorate in their favor. A team of my colleagues has reported that Musk is now driving big changes at the Social Security Administration that have braided aspects of his rhetoric about the agency directly into policy. The agency is placing certain immigrants — people who are very much alive — on the agency’s list of dead people, cutting them off from crucial financial services in an effort to push them to leave the country. I called my colleague Alexandra Berzon to talk about this reporting, and she explained that, according to the White House's own accounting, the targeted migrants did not receive much in the way of government benefits — and none of them received Social Security. The new effort, she explained, is less about cost-cutting than it is about getting the Social Security Administration into the business of immigration enforcement, a push that has deeply alarmed current and former employees of the agency. Explain to me what you and our colleagues discovered when reporting this story. How is the Trump administration using Social Security as a tool for immigration policy?

"The plan would put a strip along the southern border under Pentagon control, allowing the military to detain migrants for trespassing on a military base until Border Patrol agents could arrest them.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The plan would put a strip along the southern border under Pentagon control, allowing the military to detain migrants for trespassing on a military base until Border Patrol agents could arrest them. By Maggie HabermanEric Schmitt and Hamed Aleaziz President Trump announced a plan on Friday to turn a narrow strip along the Mexican border in California, Arizona and New Mexico into a military installation as part of his effort to curtail illegal crossings. The plan, set out in a White House memorandum, calls for transferring authority over the 60-foot-wide strip of federal border land known as the Roosevelt Reservation from other cabinet agencies to the Defense Department. Military forces patrolling that area could then temporarily detain migrants passing through for trespassing on a military reservation, said a U.S. military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters. The directive expands a military presence that has increased steadily along the southern border, even as crossings have already dropped precipitously during the Trump administration. The ordering of troops to the border has already put the military in politically charged territory, and, depending on the details of the effort, the plan could run afoul of laws that limit the use of regular federal troops for domestic law enforcement. The directive says that the border strip will become a “military installation under the jurisdiction of” the Pentagon. Military members would be able to stop anyone crossing into the “military installation” but would not have the power to make immigration arrests, according to the military official. Border Patrol agents could then be summoned to arrest the migrants. The memorandum formalizes a plan that the administration had been considering for weeks. The Washington Post had reported on the plan earlier. A White House spokesman did not respond to questions seeking clarity as to what U.S. forces operating in the strip of border land would be able to do. A Defense Department spokesman also did not respond to questions seeking clarity. Military officials are still working out how to execute the plan, including how long troops could detain migrants before turning them over to Border Patrol agents, and what type of “no trespassing” signs needed to be installed along the border, warning migrants they were about to enter a U.S. military reservation. Then there are other logistics that would have to be hammered out, such as the languages the signs are written in, and how far apart they are posted. There is also the question of where to position military patrols along hundreds of miles of rugged land along the border, and what additional training those troops might need. Adam Isacson, who focuses on border security and human rights at the Washington Office on Latin America, said the memorandum appeared to create a path for using quasi-military personnel to detain migrants. A section of the memorandum calls for the authorization of state National Guard members to work on the military-controlled strip. If those working at the installation hold migrants until Customs and Border Protection officials pick them up, their use “comes very close to military personnel detaining migrants,” Mr. Isacson said.

"While the shuffling of artwork in the president’s residence drew criticism, that kind of rotation is common with the change of administrations.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by While the shuffling of artwork in the president’s residence drew criticism, that kind of rotation is common with the change of administrations. By Tim Balk The Trump administration said on Friday that it had moved a portrait of former President Barack Obama in a White House hallway and replaced it with a pop-art painting of President Trump pumping his fist after the assassination attempt last year on the campaign trail in Butler, Pa. The shuffling of décor is not uncommon at the White House, where portraits are rotated often. But the new, striking artwork depicting Mr. Trump drew criticism from some presidential historians, who could not recall another president hanging a painting of himself during his term in the White House. Typically, paintings of presidents and first ladies are hung in the White House after they have left office, historians said. A spokesman for Mr. Obama declined to comment. The portrait of Mr. Obama, which was unveiled in the East Room during the administration of President Joseph R. Biden Jr., shows the former president in a dark suit and silver tie, standing with his hands in his pockets. The background is white; the portrait was based on photographs taken by the artist Robert McCurdy. The new painting shows Mr. Trump embraced by a team of Secret Service agents as an American flag billows in a cloudless blue sky behind him. Streaks of red run across his face.

"Southern California Edison is echoing calls from homeowners to move spark-prone electrical equipment underground. Company officials estimated the cost at more than $650 million.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","U.S. Wildfires Advertisement Supported by Southern California Edison is echoing calls from homeowners to move spark-prone electrical equipment underground. Company officials estimated the cost at more than $650 million. By Shawn Hubler and Ivan Penn Reporting from Los Angeles Southern California Edison, the electric utility whose equipment has been the focus of investigations into the deadly Eaton fire in Los Angeles County in January, said on Friday that it planned to bury more than 150 miles of power lines in fire-prone areas near Altadena and Malibu, Calif. The project would require approval from state regulators, would take years to complete and would cover only a fraction of the utility’s vast service area. Still, underground lines have been among the top requests from fire-ravaged communities as Los Angeles looks to rebuild. In a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, company officials estimated the cost of the project at more than $650 million. That amounts to about two-thirds of the nearly $1 billion that the utility estimated it would cost to rebuild the infrastructure that was damaged or destroyed in the wildfires that began on Jan. 7. Much of that cost is expected to be passed on to customers. But, officials said, the project will address a significant risk in two of Southern California’s most fire-prone areas. Officials said at least 90 miles of power lines would be buried in Malibu, and more than 60 miles in and around high-risk fire zones in Altadena, where the Eaton fire burned. “SCE will build back a resilient, reliable grid for our customers,” Steven Powell, the president and chief executive of the utility, said in a statement. Officials said on Friday that any distribution circuits not buried underground would be “hardened with covered conductor.” Company officials said in the letter that the investigation into the cause of the fire was still in progress, but they “acknowledged the possibility of SCE’s equipment being involved in the cause of the Eaton fire.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The founding LIV Golf commissioner talked with The Times soon after stepping down as chief executive of the Saudi-backed tour that fractured the sport.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","Q. and A. The founding LIV Golf commissioner talked with The Times soon after stepping down as chief executive of the Saudi-backed tour that fractured the sport. Credit...Scott McIntyre for The New York Times Supported by By Alan Blinder Reporting from Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. The man in the Aston Martin skipped the valet stand and cruised through the South Florida parking lot alone, his window lowered. Even at a distance, his hair and side profile announced Greg Norman. Few golfers have been more talented, more ubiquitous or more divisive across the nearly 50 years since he turned professional. He spent 331 weeks as the world’s top-ranked golfer, and won the British Open twice. But there were letdowns at other majors: eight runner-up finishes, including three at the Masters Tournament, which concludes Sunday at Augusta National Golf Club. He had swagger and marketing savvy. But there was an ill-fated attempt in the 1990s to create a World Golf Tour that infuriated the PGA Tour and, later, perhaps Mr. Norman’s most contested act: serving as the commissioner of LIV Golf, the league bankrolled by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, starting in 2021. The circuit’s emergence split the men’s game and left the Australian golfer widely derided as a glib, greedy apologist for Saudi Arabia and its human rights abuses. Now, the PGA Tour that once condemned LIV is trying to cut a deal with the wealth fund and its leader, Yasir al-Rumayyan. In February, about a month after Mr. Norman left his job as LIV’s chief executive, President Trump hosted a meeting between Mr. al-Rumayyan and Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner. Talks seem to have stalled since, with the PGA Tour rejecting a wealth fund proposal that would have permitted LIV to continue. And on Friday, a report released by Democrats on a Senate investigative committee said that the Saudi investment in the PGA Tour “does not make business sense unless it is an effort to buy long-term influence.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Heightened immigration enforcement is stirring anxiety among children whose parents are vulnerable to deportation. “Every day I worry they could take my mom.”",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration  Heightened immigration enforcement is stirring anxiety among children whose parents are vulnerable to deportation. “Every day I worry they could take my mom.”  Heightened immigration enforcement is stirring anxiety among children whose parents are vulnerable to deportation. “Every day I worry they could take my mom.” Nine million children live in U.S. households with at least one noncitizen adult who could be affected by immigration enforcement.Credit...Jimena Peck for The New York Times Supported by By Miriam Jordan During President Trump’s first term in the White House, Nadene Casteel’s students at an elementary school near Houston lamented that his border wall, as they understood it, would prevent them from seeing their grandmothers and other relatives in Mexico. These days, she said, they are terrified that immigration agents will take away their parents. “I have had kids coming to school saying, ‘Daddy’s gone — Daddy can’t come home,’” she said. Mr. Trump focused his immigration crackdown on the southern border during his first term. His administration separated thousands of migrant children from their parents after they had crossed into the United States. The policy was intended to discourage family migration, and it set off public outrage as images surfaced of weeping toddlers pulled from their mothers’ arms. This time, Mr. Trump has shifted his attention to the interior of the country, as he seeks to fulfill his pledge to carry out mass deportations — a goal that has drawn relatively broad support. And teachers, parents and other caregivers say the very public detention and deportation effort is taking a particularly heavy toll on young people in immigrant families. “Every day I worry they could take my mom,” Ximena, 11 — who was born in California and whose Mexican mother has lived in the United States for decades — said before breaking into tears. Nine million children, 17 percent of all 5- to 17-year-olds, live in a U.S. household with at least one noncitizen adult who could be affected by immigration enforcement, according to a report released this month by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The share is one in three children in California and about one in four in Nevada, New Jersey and Texas. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"California’s governor has diagnosed one problem for Democrats — connecting with young men — and he sees his podcast as a way to address that. Other Democrats aren’t so sure.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by California’s governor has diagnosed one problem for Democrats — connecting with young men — and he sees his podcast as a way to address that. Other Democrats aren’t so sure. By Laurel Rosenhall Reporting from Sacramento and Modesto, Calif. It was a surprising revelation at the start of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new podcast. His son had become a fan of Charlie Kirk, the right-wing influencer who mobilized young voters for Donald J. Trump. Mr. Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, said that 13-year-old Hunter was such an admirer that he argued his father should let him attend the taping with Mr. Kirk. “‘What time? What time is Charlie going to be here?’” Mr. Newsom recounted his son saying at bedtime. “And I’m like, ‘Dude, you’re in school tomorrow.’” That Mr. Kirk had captivated the son of a leading Democrat and a feminist documentarian, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, was an indication of just how popular conservative podcasters had become with young men. Many expected Mr. Newsom to respond to Mr. Trump’s presidential victory by seizing the mantle as the voice of the resistance. Instead, he has become a different kind of voice entirely — the one on the podcast. The governor has been using his new platform to explore what Democrats need to do to win back young men. Along the way, he has tried to charm far-right figures, angering many in his own party and inspiring critiques that he’s attempting to remake his image as a member of the liberal elite with well-coifed hair as he eyes a potential run for president in 2028. The first three guests on Mr. Newsom’s show — officially titled “This Is Gavin Newsom” — were conservative men who have enraged Democrats in the past. Besides Mr. Kirk, who has criticized gay marriage and diversity programs, there was also Steve Bannon, an architect of the MAGA movement, and Michael Savage, a conservative talk show firebrand.

"The Upstate region of South Carolina was saved by foreign companies after the fall of its textile industry. Now, tariffs pose another round of uncertainty.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The Upstate region of South Carolina was saved by foreign companies after the fall of its textile industry. Now, tariffs pose another round of uncertainty. By Eduardo Medina Reporting from Spartanburg, Union and Greenville, S.C. In the 1970s, when the Upstate region of South Carolina was known as the textile capital of the world, Adolphus Jones would clock in for grueling summer shifts at one of the many mills in Union, his hometown. Trains roared around him, transporting materials around the country. Chimney stacks on the red brick mills stretched dozens of feet high, like flag poles. This was textile country, and the cities of Union, Spartanburg and Greenville were at the heart of it. By the end of the 1990s, automation and cheaper labor overseas took the industry away from the state. Union’s economy cratered, as did most of the region’s. But leaving Sunday church service on a recent afternoon, Mr. Jones, now 71 and retired, scoffed at President Trump’s vision of an American manufacturing revival through tariffs. The mill work had paid little, Mr. Jones recalled, and upward mobility was nonexistent. “The textile industry is dead,” he said, buttoning his wool suit made in Italy. “Why would you want to bring it back here? Truthfully, why would the younger generation want to work there?” Since taking office, Mr. Trump has imposed and suspended tariffs on imports at breakneck speed, with the goal of forcing companies to bring manufacturing back to the United States.

"After a week of court challenges — and market swings — The New York Times journalists Zolan Kanno-Youngs, Hamed Aleaziz and Jonathan Swan discuss how President Trump is consolidating power in his second term.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by transcript Reporter: Backtracking on tariffs ... “I think the word would be flexible. You have to be flexible. I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn’t retaliate.” Reporter: ... while doubling down on deportations. “Those monsters can now be hunted down and expelled from this country with speed, force and efficiency.” Reporter: It’s been a volatile week in Washington. “These are real consequences for the American people. This is amateur hour, and it needs to stop.” Reporter: As two of Trump’s signature policies were tested by the markets and the courts, from The New York Times, this is The Roundtable. I’m Zolan Kanno-Youngs with Hamed Aleaziz and Jonathan Swan. All right. So, guys, I feel like a lot has happened this week and especially on two, on these two issues that we’re going to be talking about: tariffs and immigration. So, Hamed, you are an expert on immigration policy, and so much of the policies that we’re talking about goes even further than what we saw in the first Trump term, right? What do you think is the reason for that? I feel like they believe they have a mandate from the American public to carry out a mass deportation campaign. They look at the poll numbers. They see that Americans were not pleased with the way the Biden administration was handling immigration, and they support deportation. So, I think that makes them feel like, OK, this is our time to throw everything against the wall. And at the same time, you have leadership like the D.H.S. secretary, Kristi Noem, who’s very aggressive. The first go-around, we had, obviously Kirstjen Nielsen and John Kelly. These were people who were, compared to other Trump officials, more restrained. And later on, they had career officials running the Department of Homeland Security as well. This go-around, Kristi Noem is willing to do whatever - “To go to a prison in El Salvador while there’s deportees there.” Exactly. “And essentially do a photo op there.” Exactly. “Do not come to our country illegally. You will be removed, and you will be prosecuted. But know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.” Go on ICE raids with ICE agents wearing the tactical gear, carrying weapons. This is something that we’ve never seen before. And I think that’s the main difference, is now the leadership in place is willing to take it. You mentioned the career officials. Is this by design, Jonathan, that you now have a cast around Trump that’s less likely to push back on some of these policies? Very much so. When he left office in 2021, his biggest regret from the first term was who he hired. Just think about it from Trump’s perspective. Term one, comes in, businessman never been in government. Doesn’t really know what he’s doing. Picks a bunch of people who he’s never really met before. A lot of them were Washington establishment-type figures who fundamentally disagreed with him on economics, foreign policy, national security, a number of issues. Trump resents that. He makes a bunch of decisions that he’s later quite angry that he allowed these advisers to talk him into X, Y and Z. So for a second term, he doesn’t want that. He wants to do it his way. And just think about it from his perspective. Everyone has told him you’ll never be president again. You’re finished after Jan. 6. He gets indicted in four different jurisdictions. He gets criminally convicted, he gets shot, and then he becomes president again. Can you imagine the level of confidence that you take into the White House, someone who’s already extremely self-confident? The ability of Trump to overcome all of that, I think, has supercharged his confidence. He has no opposition. Congress is not really - you could hardly describe it as a separate branch. I mean, it is basically Trump staffers. The leadership certainly is doing exactly what Trump wants. He’s not going to get impeached. He’s also immune. The Supreme Court has conferred broad immunity upon him. It’s total impunity and unaccountability. So, Jonathan, if my friend comes up to me at a bar and asks me like, what just happened with this tariff saga with the president, what would you what should I say? Was it a capitulation? What do you think made him freeze, it right? When I think of Trump this Trump term, I think of somebody who hasn’t backed down in some instances and continued to charge forward. What made him in this instance, you and our colleagues on the White House team have been reporting a lot about this. I was having a conversation like a couple of months ago with our colleague Tom Friedman on the opinion desk, and he said, I don’t really believe in politics anymore. But I believe in physics. And I would tweak that quote slightly to say, I believe in the bond markets. OK? Like, Donald Trump was staring down a potential financial panic. “People were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy, you know? They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.” All the signals were highly alarming to his team. There was basically a loss of confidence in America and a sense that this could really spiral out of control into a full-blown crisis. I mean, $10 trillion was wiped out of the stock market. You know, that’s a bit of pain to endure. But Donald Trump doesn’t want to be the person held responsible for a recession. That’s what drove this decision. It was a fear-driven decision. All his aides are now out there saying this was the strategy all along, the plan all along. “This was his strategy all along.” “This was not a walk-back. This was not something that the bond markets were cratering and you were worried about it.” Total garbage. Total. Yeah. Like, let’s be, like, let’s be respectful of our audience. Completely absurd. This was forced upon them by really serious concerns about financial panic. “I haven’t spoken to the president since. .. “So the trade representative hasn’t spoken to the president of the United States about a global reordering of trade.” “Yes, I have. And I’m in a hearing with you, sir. ...” “But yet he announced it on a tweet. WTF?” I saw various Democrats pointing to Trump’s Truth Social post in the morning where he seemed to say, paraphrasing, but now is the time to buy. We had a bunch of different Democrats saying, accusing the administration of market manipulation. “We need to get to the bottom of the possible stock manipulation that is unfolding.” “I think we need a full, independent investigation into who was trading, who made money, who knew what and when they knew it.” I wonder if this moment could be one that also prompts the Democrats to sort of coalesce around a unified message, because they’ve kind of been picking their punches thus far. It seems like they’ve been cautious thus far. What do you think? Yeah, I still await evidence that the Democrats can get their act together. If there’s ever an opportunity, it’s the economy. And when you talk to a lot of Democratic strategists, their analysis, a lot of mainstream Democratic strategists, their analysis of the election was we lost the debate on immigration. We lost the cultural debate. But they all acknowledged that if prices stay high, if the economy is wobbly, if families are feeling stressed, that this is a real danger zone for Donald Trump. And remember, it’s true that many Americans don’t own stocks, but a lot of people are invested in the stock market through their 401(k)s, and there was, again, the reason Donald Trump made this decision is this could have bled into the real economy. If the economy is one issue that the president, you could argue, won the election on, the other is immigration here. So do you think like this expansion that we’re seeing is an effort to sort of make good on political promises, or is there something more there in terms of the motive? I think they’re trying to make people feel uncomfortable. I think they are not so far, they have not conducted a mass deportation campaign. The numbers that were promised during the campaign have not been realized and are not on track to be realized. How do you get there? You get people to feel uncomfortable and decide to leave on their own accord. That’s why you’ve seen lately them talk about self-deportation repeatedly, right. You see them say, don’t make us come to your home and arrest you. Leave , leave by yourself. And this is a message that Tom Homan is spreading. This is a message that the D.H.S. secretary, Kristi Noem, is spreading. “So we will help you buy your plane ticket and your travel documents so that you can go today.” That is potentially their only way of getting to those high numbers. One thing we haven’t talked about yet is the administration’s use of this wartime authority to continue to try to deport Venezuelans with little to no due process. This law we’re talking about, the Alien Enemies Act, we’ve had some back and forth with the courts here. But I think one thing is clear is this administration is not going to shy away or back down from using this policy at this point. They’re still determined to continue to use this, right? Definitely. I think this is something that they’ve been planning to use for a while, and they feel like the path has been laid for them to continue to use it. And it helps a lot. Ultimately, it’s very helpful to deport people without little, without much due process, because that due process bogs down the system and makes it harder to get those deportation numbers up. Are you hearing from anyone on the inside who’s uncomfortable with what they’re seeing, rattled by what they’re seeing thus far? Definitely. It feels like for folks that I’ve talked to a sense of, you know, what’s next. What else are we going to be asked to do. What was surprising to me was seeing him target college students. These students who have protested on campuses, pro-Gaza protesters that the Trump administration targeted, picked up. And these were people who were here with green cards, visas, and they were thrown into ICE detention. And the administration right now is arguing that we need to remove them because it serves foreign policy of the United States. This is something I had never heard of before. And one thing that’s much different this time, I would say as well, is the general attack on federal employees is also on D.H.S., the D.H.S. secretary has talked about repeatedly that they will root out leaks. And one way to do that is to polygraph people. That didn’t happen the first Trump administration. And at the same time, there’s a real fear around losing their jobs, people losing their jobs through the general reduction in force that Elon Musk and others has pushed. So you have a really, a bad culture right now at the department. People feeling uneasy on all levels. Is that culture, that same sort of anxious vibe, inside, is that shared by some of the president’s economic advisers or is it just full loyalty? Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, was not thrilled, to say the least, about the tariff roll-out last week and the aggressiveness and the breadth of the tariffs. I mean, even a person like Howard Lutnick, the Commerce secretary, who publicly is a cheerleader for the tariffs, privately was arguing strenuously for more exemptions. So yeah, 100 percen, there are disagreements and tensions on the team. But nobody’s arguing for no tariffs. No one who’s working for Donald Trump at this point is like, Oh you know what? Maybe we could talk him out of this tariff thing. It’s like, no, no, that ship has sailed. So it’s arguments that are about the level of the tariffs, the breadth of the tariffs, the targeting, et cetera. No one’s saying, sir, we shouldn’t do tariffs. So if that’s the feel from his economic advisers, Jonathan, I know one thing you’ve been tracking too is the response from the business community when it comes to these tariffs, whether it’s some private law firms, the private sector too. What’s the business community’s reaction been so far to this saga? Well, I mean, they hate the tariffs, of course. But if you’re a C.E.O. with any perception or intelligence, you realize that attacking Donald Trump publicly, while it might be principled, is probably not going to get you a good outcome. And what we’ve seen taking, setting tariffs aside for a second, I mean, this parade of business people offering him money, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, it’s pretty clear that they’re all worried about him targeting them. And the Trump people weaponized this very effectively. They monetize it, actually. It’s not just that Trump collects the million-dollar check for his inauguration. His people will then hit them up again, phone call and say, hey, it’d be real nice if you gave us $10 million for our PAC. I mean, it’s just basically saying, hey, guys, you might want to give us some money. I mean, the law firms is just brazen and Trump. I mean, Trump’s very proud of it, which is basically, we are going to go after you unless you promise us - the number keeps going up, I think it’s now like 100 million, $125 million worth of pro bono work to support our causes. “So I have a lot of legal fees I could give to you people, but, and we might as well use them. Hopefully I won’t need that many legal fees or that much. I may.” I mean, this is astonishing. What’s astonishing, just in terms of comparing this to term one, I mean, I remember the word resistance getting thrown around so much, remember law firms filing lawsuits. To see it to this level, where now you’re seeing this money go out. But it’s something else on the thing we’re working on, myself and a number of my colleagues is: term one, his retribution was haphazard. It was often informal, off the cuff. A lot of it was done secretively. Now it’s just, it’s streamlined. It’s formalized. It comes in the form of public presidential decrees. He signed executive orders directing his government to examine the activities of two of his critics who used to work in his administration, Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor, former D.H.S. official, too. He just named them. Just named them. It’s very out in the open, and the message to his critics and his adversaries is, you could be next. All of these pre-emptive capitulations that you see, it’s just how can I get out in front of this. How can I not be next. How much of that is a motive behind his tariffs. Does Donald Trump also just like the action of threatening tariffs, hanging it over nations and watching to see what they’ll do. As we talk about retribution, as we talk about Trump asserting his power over these various aspects of society, just how much of the tariffs are actually about him kind of wanting to see these countries come to the White House begging? I think two things can be true. I think it’s indisputably true, Trump says it himself, you can see how much he’s enjoying, he says they’re all kissing my ass. They’re all coming and begging - real quote, by the way “I’m telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass. They are. They are dying to make a deal. Please please, sir. Make a deal. I’ll do anything. I’ll do anything, sir.” He literally said that on the record. And he loves this, I call it a begging economy that he’s kind of created. But it’s also true that he’s been talking about tariffs for 40 years. And it’s an issue he actually does have a belief in, a deep belief in and a pretty consistent belief in, which is unusual for Donald Trump in that he believes that foreign nations have been ripping America off. America has been led by stupid people who’ve squandered American wealth, squandered American jobs. And he sees tariffs as this almost magic solution for - there’s no problem that can’t be solved with a good tariff. If it’s that central to his identity, going back to his business days, too, is he listening to anybody on it? It’s not that he’s not listening to anyone. Obviously, what they saw in the markets caused him to have a pretty dramatic reversal. But it took the blinking red lights for him to pull back. What about on immigration? Who does the president listen to? We, us three talk about this a lot. Let’s tell folks who are the inner circle that can really advise the president on immigration? Well, I think Tom Homan is a key figure. This is somebody that President Trump has talked about fondly for years. During the first Trump administration, President Trump was talking about him repeatedly when Mr Homan was running ICE. He sees him as one of the loyal figures in the administration. And he’s the, I think he sees Homan as somebody who knows his stuff, who’s a lawman, who’s been in federal law enforcement for decades and believes in the Trump policies, in cracking down, in mass deportations. Who else, who else in terms is the president.... Stephen Miller is the architect. Yeah, he’s the architect. And he has the longest exposure to Trump on this issue. I mean, when Stephen Miller came onto the campaign in 2015, he traveled around with him, was a very small team, and he has been obsessed with immigration since he was a high school student. And the issue looms so large for him above every other issue. I mean, Stephen Miller is in charge of all domestic policy from the White House, deputy chief of staff in charge. That’s a difference from first time. He has broader power, much more power. But for Stephen Miller, every issue always links back to immigration. A lot of what he told us on the record then is what they’re exactly what they’re doing right now. And Trump trusts him. He’s got his ear. You could make a case that he is the most powerful, if not one of the most powerful unelected people in the country. I mean, he’s the most powerful unelected people in the country - 100 percent - and do you think he distinguishes between legal immigration and illegal immigration? He definitely distinguishes between them. But there are certain categories of immigrants that are legal, but Steven views as illegitimate. Steven Miller views like a temporary protected status or something like that. They would view them all generally as people who shouldn’t be in this country. The student visa, kind of I think, almost factors into that description, too, because one thing that we’ve heard a lot from Trump’s aides is, as this crackdown has gone on, they’ve said, look, a student visa is a privilege. It is a privilege that can be revoked. As, and we’re seeing it revoked when - Which is true - Obviously, like obviously true. No one’s suggesting what they’re doing is illegal, is it, on the student visa stuff? I suppose there’s a free speech component to it. Yeah, I mean, some of this is going to be tested in federal courts, is whether or not you can broadly say that you can take away somebody’s green card because the secretary of state says so. Yes, it’s true that you can revoke a student visa, that you can rescind a green card if you’re charged for a crime, a violent crime. But what we’re seeing here are also college students that have participated in protests, pro-Palestine, anti-Israel protests in some cases, and we lack evidence for a lot of these cases because the administration hasn’t presented it or provided it. It does seem to be a free speech issue. Here again, they’re citing another obscure statute that basically says that these folks engaged in activity that undermined U.S. foreign policy. Therefore, we will rescind your student visa, rescind your green card. That seems very broad to me. Activity that undermines foreign policy. They’ve argued antisemitism thus far. But are your sources telling you how much further they could take the use of that statute? I haven’t heard that yet, but I think you’re right, that that statute could be used broadly. And I think it’s important to think about this. The way they’re talking about these people is in the frame of threats, terror threats. These are people who are terrorist sympathizers, who are potentially liable to do damage to our country. But when it comes to this provision being used, we’ve never really seen this be used on a repeated basis like we’ve seen in the last few months. It’s completely new. Totally new. There have been a lot of local stories across the country about college students losing their visas. Outside of the context of what we heard a few weeks ago, where people were getting their visas revoked for protesting, this appears to be a broader effort where hundreds of students and campuses across the country are getting their visas revoked, and there is no clarity or transparency from the government on what this is all about. And what specifically is happening is something that really has not been answered yet, and it’s causing mass panic amongst international students. You’re talking beyond just the protests? Definitely beyond the protest, beyond the protest. This is where on campuses where there wasn’t a mass, mass protest happening, right. What we’re seeing in almost every state, I mean, we’re hearing about this every single day. I know we’re reporting nonstop. But appreciate you guys joining.

Hosted by Zolan Kanno-Youngs Featuring Jonathan Swan and Hamed Aleaziz Produced by Sophie Erickson and Chevaz Clarke Video by Mark ZemelJeremy RocklinAmy MarinoRay Whitehouse and Zach Wood It’s been a turbulent week in Washington, as two of President Trump’s signature policies were tested by the markets, and the courts. A wildly unpopular tariff policy was implemented and reversed in a matter of days. And after a series of conflicting court rulings, the Trump administration is still fighting to deport Venezuelan migrants with little to no due process, while extending its crackdown on student visa holders.

"Many Americans have purchased foreign-made products out of fears that companies could start to raise prices soon.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by Many Americans have purchased foreign-made products out of fears that companies could start to raise prices soon. By Madeleine Ngo Reporting from Washington Emily Moen, a coffee shop manager in Omaha, was scrolling through TikTok earlier this week when she came across a video informing her that President Trump’s tariffs could lead to higher prices for essential baby products. Ms. Moen, who is 15 weeks pregnant, said that she had not planned to buy a car seat soon. But after watching the video, she researched the one made by Graco that she had been eyeing, and learned that it was manufactured in China. Worried that the $200 seat could get even more expensive, she bought the item on Amazon the same day. “It was like an awakening to get this done now,” said Ms. Moen, 29. As the Trump administration’s trade war with China escalates, many consumers have raced to purchase foreign-made products out of fear that companies could start to raise prices soon. Some have rushed to buy big-ticket items like iPhones and refrigerators. Others have hurriedly placed orders for cheap goods from Chinese e-commerce platforms. The White House this week imposed a minimum tariff rate of 145 percent on all Chinese imports to the United States, on top of other previously announced levies, including a 25 percent tariff on steel, aluminum, cars and car parts. And last week, Mr. Trump ordered the end of a loophole that had allowed goods from China worth less than $800 to enter the United States without tariffs.

"The Treasury secretary received counsel and criticism from some of his predecessors over President Trump’s policies.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The Treasury secretary received counsel and criticism from some of his predecessors over President Trump’s policies. By Alan Rappeport Alan Rappeport has covered the Treasury Department since 2017. The traditional gathering of former Treasury secretaries to welcome a newly minted one into the fold is usually a lighthearted and pleasant affair. But when the group convened this month, on President Trump’s “Liberation Day,” the tone was strikingly serious. The dinner, organized by former Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, took place at a moment of tumult for the U.S. economy. The president had upended global trade with punishing tariffs on both allies and adversaries, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was at the center of it, defending a policy that many in the room viewed as economic malpractice. “The mood was somber,” said W. Michael Blumenthal, 99, who led the Treasury Department in the Carter administration and was in attendance. Mr. Bessent was pressed over the strategy behind the tariffs and the impact that they would have on the economy, according to Mr. Blumenthal and other people familiar with the dinner. At times, Mr. Bessent elevated his voice when his predecessors confronted him about Mr. Trump’s approach. “He didn’t just smile,” Mr. Blumenthal recalled. “There he is — he has to defend it.” The guest list included Robert E. Rubin, Henry M. Paulson, Lawrence H. Summers, Timothy F. Geithner and Jack Lew. Former Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen was traveling in Australia and did not attend, a spokesman said. The Treasury Department declined to comment on the dinner, and Mr. Bessent declined to comment for this article. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The Michigan governor’s awkward Oval Office appearance reflected how several Democratic state leaders are cultivating cordial but politically risky relationships with the president.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Michigan governor’s awkward Oval Office appearance reflected how several Democratic state leaders are cultivating cordial but politically risky relationships with the president. By Reid J. Epstein and Tyler Pager Reporting from Washington Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan stood glumly in the Oval Office, hoping no one would take her picture. She had not expected to be there, standing in front of the cameras, as President Trump signed executive orders punishing those who opposed his 2020 election lies. Ms. Whitmer, a prominent Democrat seen as a possible 2028 presidential candidate, had come to the White House to discuss funding for an Air National Guard base near Detroit and aid for thousands of Michiganders who had just been hit by an ice storm. Then Mr. Trump’s aides surprised her on Wednesday by ushering her into the Oval Office not for her scheduled one-on-one meeting with the president, but for a politically loaded appearance before the press corps. She found herself an unwilling participant in his unending reality show, with photos of her rocketing around group chats of Democratic strategists who wondered what on earth she was doing. The episode was the result of a remarkable attempt at reconciliation between Ms. Whitmer and Mr. Trump, who dismissed her in 2020 as “that woman from Michigan” during a clash over his administration’s pandemic response. The day after the inauguration, Ms. Whitmer penned a handwritten letter — which has not been previously reported — congratulating Mr. Trump, saying she looked forward to working together and praising his support for the auto industry in his first address, according to a person who relayed the text of the letter. Ms. Whitmer included her cellphone number and invited Mr. Trump to call her if she could be of any help to him. The outreach worked for her, but it came at a cost. Her whipsaw experience with Mr. Trump illustrates the political risks that Democratic governors face as a small group of them try to cultivate relationships with a president reviled by their party but in control of vast amounts of federal funding for states.

"More than two dozen are joining a legal effort to free a Tufts University student the Trump administration is trying to deport because of her pro-Palestinian views.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by More than two dozen are joining a legal effort to free a Tufts University student the Trump administration is trying to deport because of her pro-Palestinian views. By Anemona Hartocollis They are a group of progressive Jewish organizations and congregations, and they are coming to the defense of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Muslim graduate student at Tufts, who faces deportation after she helped write an essay critical of Israel. The coalition includes synagogues in places like West Newton, Mass., San Francisco and the Upper West Side of New York, along with J Street, a pro-Israel advocacy group. On Thursday, they filed a brief in federal court in Burlington, Vt., objecting to the tactics the government was using against Ms. Ozturk in the name of combating antisemitism. In the brief, the groups argued she should be released from the Louisiana immigration detention center where she has been held for over two weeks, after masked immigration agents surrounded and arrested her on a street near her home in Somerville, Mass. “Jewish people came to America to escape generations of similar predations,” the brief says. “Yet the images of Ozturk’s arrest in twenty-first century Massachusetts evoke the oppressive tactics employed by the authoritarian regimes that many ancestors of amici’s members left behind in Odessa, Kishinev, and Warsaw.” There have been reports of almost 1,000 international students and scholars at universities across the country who have lost their legal status since mid-March, according to the Association of International Educators. Anecdotally, the visas have typically been revoked with little or no notice and without telling the students what they might have done wrong. In some cases, students have committed legal infractions, like speeding or driving while drunk, according to universities and lawyers that are monitoring the revocations. But some have not. If the students do not leave voluntarily, they face deportation. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Rory McIlroy, a 35-year-old Irishman who had previously competed in the Masters 16 times, won his first green jacket on Sunday. The tournament ended in a playoff between McIlroy and Englishman Justin Rose, who both ended the final round at 11 under par. McIlroy’s win places him among a select few golfers to achieve a career Grand Slam — victories in golf’s four major championships. He narrowly missed a Masters win in 2022 when he finished as runner-up. Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson were honorary starters during a ceremony at the beginning of the first round.

"Two to five inches of snow fell over an area stretching from Albany, N.Y., to Maine overnight Friday into Saturday morning, forecasters said.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Two to five inches of snow fell over an area stretching from Albany, N.Y., to Maine overnight Friday into Saturday morning, forecasters said. By Claire Fahy Residents across a broad stretch of the Northeast woke up on Saturday to snow blanketing backyards and frosting trees, just as the pastel colors of Easter promised that spring was near. An area stretching from around Albany, N.Y., to Maine experienced moderate snowfall, mostly from two to five inches, overnight Friday into Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service. And while spring technically started on March 20, snowfall at this time of year is far from rare. “In upstate New York, you know, a couple inches here and there is certainly not unheard-of, even in the early spring,” said Abbey Gant, a meteorologist with the Weather Service office in Albany. While the Weather Service reported a trace of snow at LaGuardia Airport, there were no reports of snow in other parts of New York City. In Maine, where two to five inches of snow had fallen by Saturday morning, Michael Clair, a Weather Service meteorologist, said that the snow was “nothing we haven’t seen before.” It’s also something the state might see again before warmer weather moves in. “It’s still too early to say we’re done for sure,” Mr. Clair said. “This is sort of what our spring looks like. It’s a mix of things.” Snow was expected to continue through Saturday, tapering off as the day progressed, before the region dries out next week, forecasters said. For Jill Woodworth, 58, who grew up in Connecticut and has lived in Orange, Mass., for the past 25 years, waking up to snow in April can be routine, but it’s still shocking. “I’ve lived in this area for most of my life, and it’s not unusual, but it’s just like, ‘Oh my God,’” Ms. Woodworth said. “It feels like it’s been a long ramp up to spring with the flowers and the trees.” Ms. Woodworth said she remembered past Aprils when up to two feet of snow had fallen.

"The administration is reviewing about $9 billion in federal funding that the university receives.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by The administration is reviewing about $9 billion in federal funding that the university receives. By Edgar Sandoval Two groups representing Harvard professors sued the Trump administration on Friday, saying that its threat to cut billions in federal funding for the university violates free speech and other First Amendment rights. The lawsuit by the American Association of University Professors and the Harvard faculty chapter of the group follows the Trump administration’s announcement earlier this month that it was reviewing about $9 billion in federal funding that Harvard receives. The administration also sent the school a list of demands that it must meet if it wants to keep the funds. The suit, filed in the Federal District Court in Massachusetts, seeks a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from cutting the funds. “This action challenges the Trump administration’s unlawful and unprecedented misuse of federal funding and civil rights enforcement authority to undermine academic freedom and free speech on a university campus,” the lawsuit said. The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The Trump administration has been on a campaign against elite universities that it views as being too lax on antisemitism. In a recent letter to Harvard, the administration said the school had “fundamentally failed to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence.” Other top schools like Columbia and Cornell have also been targeted. Harvard did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. In recent weeks, Alan Garber, the university president, has said that Harvard had spent “considerable effort” during the past 15 months addressing antisemitism, adding that there was still more work to be done. In a statement, Andrew Manuel Crespo, a law professor at Harvard and general counsel of the AAUP-Harvard Faculty Chapter, said the administration’s policies are a pretext to chill universities and their faculties from engaging in speech, teaching and research that don’t align with President Trump’s views. “Harvard faculty have the constitutional right to speak, teach and conduct research without fearing that the government will retaliate against their viewpoints by canceling grants,” Mr. Crespo said. On Saturday afternoon, hundreds of protesters, including students, professors and even the mayor of Cambridge, braved the cold to protest against the Trump administration’s threat to cut Harvard’s funding. At a packed park in Cambridge, Mass., home to Harvard’s campus, they called on the university to lead the charge against the government’s crackdown on higher education. “Harvard possesses not just the resources to withstand the pressure,” said Mayor Denise Simmons of Cambridge, “but the moral obligation to do so.” Miles J. Herszenhorn contributed reporting from Cambridge, Mass. Edgar Sandoval covers Texas for The Times, with a focus on the Latino community and the border with Mexico. He is based in San Antonio.

"In situations where a mother faces risk of death, the decision allows for abortions even when death isn’t imminent.",2025-04-12,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by In situations where a mother faces risk of death, the decision allows for abortions even when death isn’t imminent. By Isabelle Taft and Pam Belluck A state judge in Idaho appeared to slightly broaden access to abortion there by ruling on Friday that an exception to the state’s ban does not require the woman to be facing impending death. Idaho’s ban, one of the strictest in the nation, prohibits abortion in almost all cases. One exception is when it is necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman. Judge Jason D. Scott ruled that abortions are allowed if a doctor deems that the woman is likely to die sooner without an abortion than she would otherwise — even if her death “is neither imminent nor assured.” The ruling, which kept the law in place, handed a partial victory to reproductive rights advocates and Idaho doctors who said the ban had forced them to wait for patients to reach the brink of death before they could act, or rush them out of state to get care elsewhere. “I feel very reassured” by the ruling, said Dr. Emily Corrigan, an Idaho obstetrician-gynecologist who is one of the plaintiffs. “I think there’s many, many more case scenarios where the patient’s condition would squarely fall within that exception.” Idaho’s attorney general, Raúl Labrador, who was one of the defendants, said in a statement that Idaho law has never required doctors to wait until a woman’s death is certain or imminent before providing an abortion. “While we still disagree with portions of the ruling, it confirms what my office has argued in courts from Boise to Washington, D.C. — that Idaho’s abortion laws are constitutional and protect both unborn children and their mothers,” he said. It was unclear on Saturday whether his office would appeal the decision. The Idaho judgment arose from a lawsuit filed in September 2023 by the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of four women who said they had to leave the state to receive abortions after learning that they faced serious health risks or that their fetuses would not survive. The suit was joined by Dr. Corrigan, another physician and a family physicians’ organization. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

By Maggie Haberman White House reporter President Trump, some of his cabinet members and his adviser Elon Musk sat ringside in Miami late Saturday night at the Ultimate Fighting Championship event — a spectacle of violence, throbbing music and cheering crowds that the president has long admired. It’s the second U.F.C. event that Mr. Trump has attended since he was elected for a second time in November, and the first of his presidency. Unlike World Wrestling Entertainment events, U.F.C. matches aren’t staged. Mr. Trump has been a fan of U.F.C. fights for years. He attended one in late 2019 in New York City during his first presidency. And he brought the chief executive of U.F.C., Dana White, onstage to speak during his victory speech on election night in 2024. But the scene on Saturday was emblematic of a president who is increasingly emboldened, brazen and encouraging of displays of force to carry out his agenda, particularly on immigration and crime. Mr. Trump walked into the Kaseya Center to the booming sounds of the Kid Rock song “American Bad Ass” and to sustained, thunderous applause from the crowd. He sat next to Mr. Musk, who had brought one of his 14 children. They sat with the F.B.I. director, Kash Patel; Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a former senator from Florida; the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard; and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, the actress Cheryl Hines. Also in the Trump entourage was Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. When Mr. Trump first arrived, he tried to shake Mr. Kennedy’s hand; Mr. Kennedy was looking in the other direction. Mr. Trump then walked past the outstretched hand of Ms. Hines, moving his gaze past her entirely despite appearing to see her. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Buoyed by the interests of the family behind Walmart, Bentonville has become an unexpected hub for cycling.",2025-04-13,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by ACROSS THE COUNTRY Buoyed by the interests of the family behind Walmart, Bentonville has become an unexpected hub for cycling. WHY WE’RE HERE We’re exploring how America defines itself one place at a time. In Bentonville, Ark., a thriving off-road biking network has drawn residents and tourists alike into mountain and gravel biking. By Emily Cochrane Video by Rugile Kaladyte Reporting from Bentonville, Ark. Listen for the click of a bike gear, shifting in tune with its rider. A whoosh of air as tires lift off the ground, then a satisfying thud as the bike returns to earth. The clack of a cyclist’s cleats, fresh off a ride, in the downtown square. This is the soundtrack to Bentonville, a city of about 60,000 near the state’s border with Missouri that has dozens of immaculately kept trails for every level of biker. “Pure joy — it’s the reason I got up at 6 o’clock this morning to be out here,” said Dani Shamburger, 33, pausing during an early Sunday ride in the woods a few miles from the city’s center. “It’s my sanctuary.” The investment in biking has come largely from the billionaire Walton family and its business, Walmart, which is headquartered in Bentonville. Over more than a decade, Tom and Steuart Walton, grandsons of the Walmart founder, have steered at least $74 million through the family foundation toward the construction of 163 miles of paths and trails for recreation and competition. Those arteries now snake through the city, connecting to hundreds of trails in the surrounding mountains. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Elon Musk now says his group will produce only 15 percent of the savings it promised. But even that estimate is inflated with errors and guesswork.",2025-04-13,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Elon Musk now says his group will produce only 15 percent of the savings it promised. But even that estimate is inflated with errors and guesswork. By David A. Fahrenthold and Jeremy Singer-Vine The reporters have been examining the details of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and its online ledger of purported savings. Last week, Elon Musk indicated for the first time that his Department of Government Efficiency was falling short of its goal. He previously said his powerful budget-cutting team could reduce the next fiscal year’s federal budget by $1 trillion, and do it by Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year. Instead, in a cabinet meeting on Thursday, Mr. Musk said that he anticipated the group would save about $150 billion, 85 percent less than its objective. Even that figure may be too high, according to a New York Times analysis of DOGE’s claims. That’s because, when Mr. Musk’s group tallies up its savings so far, it inflates its progress by including billion-dollar errors, by counting spending that will not happen in the next fiscal year — and by making guesses about spending that might not happen at all. One of the group’s largest claims, in fact, involves canceling a contract that did not exist. Although the government says it had merely asked for proposals in that case, and had not settled on a vendor or a price, Mr. Musk’s group ignored that uncertainty and assigned itself a large and very specific amount of credit for canceling it. It said it had saved exactly $318,310,328.30. Mr. Musk’s group has now triggered mass firings across the government, and sharp cutbacks in humanitarian aid around the world. Mr. Musk has justified those disruptions with two promises: that the group would be transparent, and that it would achieve budget cuts that others called impossible. Now, watching the group pare back its aims and puff up its progress, some of its allies have grown doubtful about both. On its website, the Department of Government Efficiency claims to have saved $150 billion in federal spending. As of early April, however, it has provided receipt-level breakdowns for less than 40 percent of that amount. Source: DOGE By The New York Times We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Greg Abbott of Texas is trying to stop a planned community near Dallas that has fueled anti-Muslim hostility and divided locals.  Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas is trying to stop a planned community near Dallas that has fueled anti-Muslim hostility and divided locals. The prayer room at the East Plano Islamic Center in Plano, Texas. Members of the center have proposed a master-planned community of about 1,000 homes. Credit... Supported by By J. David Goodman Photographs by Desiree Rios Reporting from Plano and Josephine, Texas In most circumstances, the development of a 400-acre field of corn and hay outside Josephine, Texas, would hardly stand out in the state, just another parcel of farmland set to become houses in the ever-expanding sprawl of the Dallas suburbs. Yet in recent months, Gov. Greg Abbott has thrown himself into stopping the planned community. The reason? It would be anchored by a mosque. “To be clear, Shariah law is not allowed in Texas,” the Republican governor wrote on social media in late February, reposting a video advertising the project. “Nor are Shariah cities.” Nearly a quarter century has passed since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, raised anti-Muslim sentiment around the country, often under the banner of fighting Islamic law, or Shariah. It has been 15 years since politicians in New York and Washington fanned the furor over a proposed Islamic center in Lower Manhattan near where the Twin Towers fell. Over that time, the population of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area has swelled by more than 60 percent, to around 8.3 million. Its growth has included a diverse influx of new Texans from all over the world, many of them Muslim, but also Hindu, Christian and Jewish. But Josephine’s master-planned community of about 1,000 homes proposed by members of the East Plano Islamic Center, known as EPIC, has shown how old sentiments can linger.

"Former Representative Barbara Lee entered the campaign for mayor of the Bay Area city as the favorite. But her main challenger has gained traction after positioning himself as the change candidate.",2025-04-13,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Former Representative Barbara Lee entered the campaign for mayor of the Bay Area city as the favorite. But her main challenger has gained traction after positioning himself as the change candidate. By Soumya Karlamangla Reporting from Oakland, Calif. When former Representative Barbara Lee announced that she would run for mayor of Oakland, Calif., many considered her victory to be a sure thing. After all, Ms. Lee had represented the city for more than a quarter-century in Congress and in the State Legislature before that. She gained national fame as a progressive lawmaker who was the only member of Congress to reject the use of force after the Sept. 11 attacks, reasoning that it gave the president too much war authority. To Ms. Lee’s supporters, her return home was seen as a worthy bookend to her career, with a chance to rescue her hometown from its doldrums and political decay. Oakland, a city of 436,000 residents across the bay from San Francisco, has suffered mightily since the pandemic as it has faced soaring crime rates, the departure of its last major sports team and a yawning budget deficit. The city had a sudden vacancy at the top because voters ousted Mayor Sheng Thao in November, a sign of their frustrations with the city’s direction and with a dark legal cloud over Ms. Thao. But Ms. Lee, 78, is no longer considered a shoo-in to win Tuesday’s election. Loren Taylor, a former Oakland City Council member, has gained traction with voters as a moderate candidate who has pledged to fix potholes, reduce crime and shorten 911 response times. Ms. Lee is still considered the heavy favorite in the field of 10 candidates. But Mr. Taylor, 47, recently surpassed her in fund-raising and landed the endorsement of the editorial board at The San Francisco Chronicle. “Oakland is broken,” Mr. Taylor often says on the campaign trail, a message that has resonated with some voters.

"The Trump administration is in a standoff with the Chinese government as trade tensions escalate, leaving U.S. businesses in the cross hairs",2025-04-13,"The New York Times","Tariffs  The Trump administration is in a standoff with the Chinese government as trade tensions escalate, leaving U.S. businesses in the cross hairs President Trump abruptly paused his “reciprocal” tariffs on most countries last week but has rapidly ratcheted up the rate on Chinese products.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York Times Supported by By Ana Swanson and Ben Casselman Ana Swanson reported from Washington and Ben Casselman from New York. President Trump’s rapidly escalating trade war with China has resulted in eye-watering tariffs on products exchanged between the countries and scrambled prospects for many global businesses that depend on the trade. And there is no end in sight. The Trump administration has been waiting for the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, to call Mr. Trump personally, but Beijing appears wary of putting Mr. Xi in an unpredictable and potentially embarrassing situation with the U.S. president. With the two governments at an impasse, businesses that rely on sourcing products from China — varying from hardware stores to toymakers — have been thrown into turmoil. The triple-digit tariff rates have forced many to halt shipments entirely. Trump officials have argued that the status quo with China on trade is not sustainable. Mr. Trump has rapidly ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese products, from 54 percent on April 2 to 145 percent just one week later. The Chinese government has argued that the actions are unfair and closely matched his moves, raising its tariffs on American goods to 125 percent on Friday. But on Friday night, the administration created a significant carve out to its tariffs on China when it exempted some electronics, including smartphones, laptops and televisions. Those products will still be subject to other tariffs that Mr. Trump has put in place, like a 20 percent fee he added to Chinese goods in response to the country’s role in the fentanyl trade. Mr. Trump has said he would like to speak with Mr. Xi, but he has stopped short of requesting a phone call, believing that it is the Chinese government’s turn to ask for such a call, according to people familiar with the matter. Trump officials say that dozens of countries have reached out to the administration about negotiations since the levies were imposed. China did not, and instead responded with harsh words and tariffs of its own. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

We celebrated our faith last night proudly. No one will deter me or my family or any Pennsylvanian from celebrating their faith openly and proudly. By Edgar SandovalJeremy W. Peters and Mike Ives Pennsylvania state authorities have arrested and charged a Harrisburg man they said set fire to the governor’s mansion while Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family slept, forcing them to evacuate early Sunday before the blaze severely damaged part of the building. The man, identified as Cody Balmer, 38, jumped a fence and managed to evade state troopers after he broke into the building, the authorities said. He fled the scene and was arrested after turning himself in to the police on Sunday afternoon, officials said at a news conference. Mr. Balmer was charged with attempted murder, arson and terrorism, the Dauphin County District Attorney’s Office said early Monday. During a news briefing on Sunday outside the fire-scarred mansion, Governor Shapiro, a Democrat who gained national prominence last year when he was on the short list of possible running mates for Kamala Harris, said that the F.B.I. was assisting in the investigation. The smell of smoke lingered in the air as he spoke, with the blackened, broken windows where the arsonist had struck visible behind him. Mr. Shapiro became emotional as he described his family’s ordeal, recalling the moment a state trooper had banged on his door shortly after 2 a.m., waking him, his wife and his children, and rushing them to safety. The attack, he said, had been “targeted.” “Last night, we experienced an attack, not just on our family, but on the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” Mr. Shapiro said. “I want you all to know that your prayers lift us up, and in this moment of darkness, we are choosing to see light.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"On Friday, the administration carved out an exception for a variety of electronics from the steep taxes now applied to Chinese imports.",2025-04-13,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by On Friday, the administration carved out an exception for a variety of electronics from the steep taxes now applied to Chinese imports. By Tony RommAna Swanson and Tripp Mickle President Trump signaled on Sunday that he would pursue new tariffs on the powerful computer chips inside smartphones and other technologies, just two days after his administration excluded a variety of electronics from the steep import taxes recently applied on goods arriving from China. The push came as Mr. Trump’s top economic advisers scrambled to explain their shifting strategy, after having insisted for weeks that they would shield no company or industry from any of the fees they have levied in a bid to reset U.S. trade relationships. The reprieve for technology companies arrived in the form of a Customs and Border Protection rule issued late Friday that spared high-tech imports from Mr. Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs, including those on China. While the president paused a set of punishing levies on nearly 60 countries last week, his administration has forged ahead with a new 145 percent tax on Chinese exports, announcing it after Beijing retaliated against the United States. The exclusions in the C.B.P. rule covered a wide slate of products, such as computers, smartphones, modems and flash drives, and it represented a major victory for Apple, and other U.S. technology giants, which rely on Chinese factories to help manufacture important components and popular devices. Apple executives had even been in contact with Trump administration officials about the Chinese tariffs in recent days, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s efforts. The company declined to comment. But on Sunday, Mr. Trump and his top aides cast the exemptions in a different light, framing them as only a temporary break while the government prepares more targeted import taxes on key technologies. The administration is expected to take the first step toward enacting the new tariffs as soon as next week, opening an investigation to determine the effects of semiconductor imports on national security. The approach appears to mirror the process that yielded Mr. Trump’s tariffs on other specific products and sectors, including the high fees he imposed on foreign cars and auto parts this year. On social media, the president signaled Sunday that the scope of his next inquiry would be broad, “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The senator appeared onstage at the music festival on Saturday night, appealing to young people to oppose President Trump.",2025-04-13,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The senator appeared onstage at the music festival on Saturday night, appealing to young people to oppose President Trump. By Matthew Mpoke Bigg Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one of the country’s leading progressives, delivered an impromptu speech onstage at the Coachella music festival in California on Saturday night in which he implored young people to oppose President Trump’s policies. Mr. Sanders, who had spoken earlier in the evening at a packed rally in downtown Los Angeles as part of a Western tour, made his comments before introducing the singer-songwriter Clairo. “This country faces some very difficult challenges, and the future of what happens to America is dependent upon your generation,” Mr. Sanders, 83, said during his brief address, which received cheers from the crowd. “We need you to stand up to fight for justice, to fight for economic justice, social justice and racial justice.” When Mr. Sanders mentioned the president of the United States, the audience booed, and the senator said, “I agree.” Mr. Sanders highlighted economic inequality, universal healthcare, threats to abortion rights and climate change as issues demanding action. He said he had come to Coachella to thank Clairo for her activism, and applauded her for speaking up for women’s rights in Gaza, noting that thousands of women and children have been killed in the war. Mr. Sanders, an independent, sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, losing to Hillary Clinton. He ran again four years later and was the last major Democratic primary rival to Joseph R. Biden Jr., who won the 2020 presidential election. The senator’s appearance at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is consistent with his popularity among young progressives who admire him as an uncompromising and outspoken firebrand.

His previous medical disclosures have drawn scrutiny.",2025-04-13,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The report is the first public accounting of the president’s health since January, when he became the oldest man ever sworn into his office. His previous medical disclosures have drawn scrutiny. By Minho Kim and Tim Balk Reporting from Washington The White House on Sunday released President Trump’s health report, which declares that Mr. Trump “is fully fit to execute the duties” of the presidency while laying out a few conditions, such as high cholesterol, for which he has been treated and the report describes as “well controlled.” The report, written by the president’s physician, Dr. Sean P. Barbabella, who is also a Navy captain, says that Mr. Trump “remains in excellent health” and “exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health.” It refers to Mr. Trump’s “frequent victories in golf events” as an example of his “active lifestyle” contributing to his physical and mental well-being. The report also notes that Mr. Trump has been treated for high cholesterol, skin damages from frequent sun exposure, seasonal allergies and diverticulosis, a condition in which small pouches, called diverticula, form in the wall of the colon. He has also had cataract surgery for both of his eyes and has had a benign colon polyp, according to the report. Mr. Trump, 78, underwent cognitive and cardiology tests during a visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland on Friday. He told reporters he felt he was in “good shape” and had a “good heart.” The White House released the results of President Trump’s annual physical examination on Sunday. The health report states that Mr. Trump has gone through “a comprehensive neurological examination” that revealed no abnormalities in cognitive function or his mental state. It says he scored 30 out of 30 points for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, a test for mental capacity in which subjects are asked to do simple tasks such as draw a clock that marks a certain time or repeat sentences that are read to them. A score of 25 or less is indicative of cognitive impairment. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

By Maya C. Miller Reporting from Washington As Democrats push back against the policies of the second Trump administration, they are struggling to convey a clear stance on tariffs, with many walking a political tightrope amid the rapid shifts in President Trump’s trade agenda. While most Democrats have criticized Mr. Trump’s on-again, off-again approach as “chaotic” and “reckless,” they have displayed little consensus about embracing tariffs themselves as a policy tool. Their divisions were on display on Sunday morning, as Democratic lawmakers were grilled by talk show hosts about whether their party was taking the right approach by objecting to Mr. Trump’s tariffs while embracing tariffs in principle as a policy tool. When pressed by NBC’s Kristen Welker, Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, denounced Mr. Trump’s trade strategy but declined to weigh in on whether he thought others in his party were taking the right approach by offering a more nuanced criticism. Ms. Welker pointed out that former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had maintained and even expanded some of the tariffs that Mr. Trump enacted in his first term, a move that some progressive Democrats had applauded at the time. “I just want to, for myself, tell you a full-throated, unequivocal condemnation of the Trump tariffs,” Mr. Booker said, blaming the trade barriers for roiling the economy and tanking Americans’ savings. “It is all just wrong. It should be condemned.” A few Democrats have even aligned themselves with Mr. Trump’s tariffs. Representative Jared Golden of Maine, a Democrat who has consistently won re-election in a Trump-won district, has embraced a 10 percent blanket tariff on imports and twice introduced a bill that would codify such levies.

Mr. Rubio added in a social media post that “the alliance” between President Trump and President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador had “become an example for security and prosperity in our hemisphere.” The deportees sent to El Salvador this weekend came from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, on an Air Force C-17 cargo plane, according to a social media message posted by El Salvador’s justice minister, Gustavo Villatoro. The administration has been holding some detainees at the U.S. naval base there. Mr. Villatoro also posted a video of men being marched off a military plane and led in shackles into a prison called the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT. The Trump administration has sent hundreds of Venezuelans to the notorious prison in El Salvador at the invitation of Mr. Bukele, who is positioning himself as a crucial regional ally to Mr. Trump and is scheduled to meet with the president in Washington on Monday. The administration has portrayed those deportees as violent criminals or terrorists, but court papers have shown that the evidence on which the government acted was often little more than whether they had tattoos or had worn clothing associated with the criminal organization.

"Lauren H. DeLoach of South Carolina admitted to importing more than $18,000 worth of sperm whale parts from Australia, Latvia, Norway and Ukraine, prosecutors said.",2025-04-13,"The New York Times","Global Economy Advertisement Supported by Lauren H. DeLoach of South Carolina admitted to importing more than $18,000 worth of sperm whale parts from Australia, Latvia, Norway and Ukraine, prosecutors said. By Johnny Diaz A South Carolina man pleaded guilty on Thursday to importing sperm whale teeth and bones from four countries and selling them in the United States, federal prosecutors said. The man, Lauren H. DeLoach, 69, of St. Helena Island, S.C., pleaded guilty to Lacey Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act charges for importing and selling sperm whale parts, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of South Carolina. Mr. DeLoach admitted to importing the sperm whale teeth and bones to South Carolina, including at least 30 shipments from Australia, Latvia, Norway and Ukraine, from July 2022 through September 2024, according to court documents and statements made in court. Mr. DeLoach sold at least 85 pieces on eBay worth more than $18,000 and labeled the items as “plastic” to avoid detection by U.S. customs officials, prosecutors said. The authorities said they had seized about $20,000 worth of sperm whale parts during a search of his residence. It was not immediately clear on Sunday how Mr. DeLoach had obtained the items and who then bought them from him. The teeth and the bones are prized for decorations or use in artwork, such as engravings and carvings, prosecutors said. Sperm whales, the largest species of toothed whale, are found in all deep oceans, from the Equator to the edge of the pack ice in the Arctic and Antarctic, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Females can grow up to 40 feet in length and males up to 52 feet, the agency said. Sperm whales have been protected under the Endangered Species Act since 1970 and under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Lacey Act makes it unlawful to sell any wildlife that has been illegally imported, prosecutors said. “Illegal wildlife trafficking is a multibillion-dollar global business that endangers protected animals and fuels organized crime,” said Brook B. Andrews, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of South Carolina. “We will continue to enforce the Lacey Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act so vulnerable species like the sperm whale are not killed and sold for parts.” Nathan S. Williams, a lawyer for Mr. DeLoach, said in a statement on Sunday that Mr. DeLoach “regrets his decisions and has accepted responsibility for them.” Mr. DeLoach faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the felony Lacey Act charge, and a maximum sentence of one year in prison for the misdemeanor Marine Mammal Protection Act violation. The case was the latest involving protected wildlife. In February, a California couple reached a plea agreement in Butte County, Calif., for violating fish and game laws after wildlife officers on a plane heard them boasting how they had once illegally hunted a mountain lion, and how they were smuggling the skull of an endangered turtle in their carry-on bag, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said.

"The cause of the enormous explosion at a house on Sunday, which could be heard miles away, was not immediately known. Officials described it as an “isolated incident.”",2025-04-13,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The cause of the enormous explosion at a house on Sunday, which could be heard miles away, was not immediately known. Officials described it as an “isolated incident.” By Johnny Diaz A home in Austin, Texas, was leveled and at least 23 others were damaged on Sunday in an explosion of unknown causes that could be heard for miles and left six people injured, the authorities said. The explosion happened just after 11 a.m. local time in a northwest section of Austin, according to the Austin Fire Department. The cause of the explosion was under investigation. The authorities said there was no signs of criminal activity in connection with the explosion. “We believe this is certainly an isolated incident,” said Division Chief Wayne Parrish of the Austin Fire Department. He said there was no gas service to the residence but it did have propane tanks. A representative for Texas Gas Service said that crews responded on Sunday morning and “confirmed the home did not have natural gas service.” A two-story house where the explosion happened collapsed and a neighboring home partially collapsed, the authorities said. Two occupants of the home where the explosion occurred were taken to a hospital. One of them was in critical condition and the other was in serious condition, Capt. Shannon Koesterer of the Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services Department told reporters at a news conference. An occupant in a neighboring home that was damaged was in critical condition, Captain Koesterer said. Another person had minor injuries, and two firefighters also had minor injuries, the captain added. The authorities said they had accounted for all of the people who were in the affected residences at the time of the blast. Officials said that garage doors and windows nearby were blown out and a car at the residence where the explosion happened caught fire. Power was out in the surrounding area because of damage from the explosion, the authorities said. The blast could be heard as far away as Georgetown, Texas, which is about 30 miles north, Chief Parrish said. The Police Department in Cedar Park, which is about 20 miles away, said on social media that it was aware of the “loud boom that was heard and felt throughout the city.” Several agencies responded to the scene, including Austin-Travis County E.M.S., the Austin Police Department, the Travis County Sheriff’s Office and the F.B.I., Chief Parrish said. The Travis County fire marshal will lead the investigation, he said. Alexandra E. Petri contributed reporting. Johnny Diaz is a reporter for The Times covering breaking news from Miami.

"The Justice Department’s latest legal filing asserted that courts cannot direct President Trump’s foreign policy by forcing the return of a man unlawfully sent to a Salvadoran prison.",2025-04-13,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Justice Department’s latest legal filing asserted that courts cannot direct President Trump’s foreign policy by forcing the return of a man unlawfully sent to a Salvadoran prison. By Alan Feuer The Trump administration on Sunday evening doubled down on its assertion that a federal judge cannot force it to bring back to the United States a Maryland man who was unlawfully deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador last month. In a brief legal filing, the Justice Department reiterated its view that courts lack the ability to dictate steps that the White House should take in seeking to return the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to U.S. soil, because the president alone has broad powers to handle foreign policy. “The federal courts have no authority to direct the executive branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner,” lawyers for the department wrote. “That is the ‘exclusive power of the president as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.’” The position taken by Trump officials was not the first time they had tried to defy efforts compelling them to seek Mr. Abrego Garcia’s return from El Salvador. Still, their continued recalcitrance meant that Mr. Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old father of three, would for now remain at the CECOT prison in El Salvador, where he was sent with scores of other migrants on March 15. The administration’s stubbornness was also likely to heighten tensions between the White House and the judge overseeing the case, Paula Xinis. Judge Xinis has scheduled a hearing to discuss next steps in the matter on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Maryland. The conflict has persisted even though the Supreme Court last week unanimously ordered the administration to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release from Salvadoran custody. Trump officials have in fact already admitted that they made an “administrative error” when they put Mr. Abrego Garcia on the plane to El Salvador in the first place.

Federal investigators said he had a broader plot to kill the president. By Livia Albeck-Ripka A Wisconsin teenager has been charged in the killing of his mother and stepfather in what the federal authorities described as an attempt to obtain the money and autonomy he believed was necessary for a plot to kill President Trump and overthrow the government. The teenager, Nikita Casap, 17, was arrested last month in the deaths of his mother, Tatiana Casap, 35, and stepfather, Donald Mayer, 51, according to the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department. Sheriff’s deputies found the bodies at the family’s home in Waukesha, about 17 miles southwest of Milwaukee, after receiving a call on Feb. 28 requesting a welfare check, the department said. According to federal documents unsealed on Friday, the fatal shootings were part of a plan by Mr. Casap, who identified with a right-wing terrorist network known as the Order of Nine Angles, to assassinate President Trump in what he believed would “foment a political revolution in the United States,” federal investigators said. Mr. Casap also paid, at least in part, for a drone and explosives that he planned to use in an attack, according to the documents, which were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Mr. Casap’s lawyers could not be immediately reached on Sunday for comment. A self-described “manifesto,” found on Mr. Casap’s phone and detailed in the federal documents, contained images and praise of Adolf Hitler, as well as instructions to others to make bombs.

"The governor was forced to evacuate from the official residence with his family. The authorities have charged a man with attempted murder, arson and terrorism.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The governor was forced to evacuate from the official residence with his family. The authorities have charged a man with attempted murder, arson and terrorism. By Yan Zhuang Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and his family were forced to flee from the governor’s official residence early Sunday when an arson attack severely damaged the mansion. The authorities arrested a man who they said had broken into the mansion in Harrisburg, Pa., and had thrown homemade incendiary devices that ignited fires into two rooms. No one was injured in the attack. The man, whom they identified as Cody Balmer, 38, has been accused of attempted murder, aggravated arson, terrorism and other offenses. Law enforcement officials have not provided any information about a specific motive. But court records and interviews suggest that Mr. Balmer had a troubled past and a history of mental illness. Here is what to know about the attack. Mr. Shapiro said that he, his wife and children were awakened shortly after 2 a.m. by a state trooper who warned them of a fire. They were rushed to safety while firefighters extinguished the flames, he said. The F.B.I. was assisting in the investigation, he added. Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat, rose to prominence last year when he was on the short list of possible running mates for Kamala Harris, the party’s nominee for president. He helped oversee the law enforcement response to the assassination attempt against Donald J. Trump in Butler, Pa., who was then campaigning for president. The 51-year-old governor, who has said that there was too much vitriol in American politics, noted that the attack on the residence occurred shortly after his family and others members of the local Jewish community had celebrated the first night of Passover in the state dining room, one of the rooms that was set ablaze in the attack.

"Some cities discourage spring breakers, but towns along the Gulf Coast, where every dollar is crucial after Hurricanes Helene and Milton, were eager for an influx.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Some cities discourage spring breakers, but towns along the Gulf Coast, where every dollar is crucial after Hurricanes Helene and Milton, were eager for an influx. By Emily Cochrane Emily Cochrane reported from beach towns along Florida’s Gulf Coast. In the beach towns west of Tampa, Fla., the message was clear for any spring breaker passing through. It appeared on chalkboard signs, waving inflatables and posters: We are open. Spring break season is fraught in some parts of Florida, where the raucous behavior of certain visitors can outweigh their economic benefit. Miami Beach has been on a yearslong campaign to deter the college crowd, including with an ad this year for a fake reality show in which partyers break the rules and suffer consequences. But for the businesses and the restaurants along the Gulf of Mexico that were ravaged by Hurricanes Helene and Milton last year, welcoming spring breakers — and anyone else, really — has been imperative. Some are still in temporary setups, or barely weeks into reopening, so every dollar is crucial. Many had anxiously anticipated the season, which began in early March and will wrap up in the next week or so, as a barometer for post-hurricane success. There are other pressures on Florida’s retail and tourism industries: Inflation and the threat of punitive tariffs have rattled the American economy. But in the Tampa-St. Petersburg region, few can remember a hurricane season as disruptive as last year’s, when Hurricanes Helene and Milton delivered a one-two punch just 13 days apart. Some businesses and hotels remain closed, and local governments have been swamped with post-storm requests for building permits; many have expedited the process by waiving fees or setting up temporary remote sites to process claims. More than 8,000 emergency rebuilding permits have been issued in St. Petersburg alone, for an estimated $150 million in construction value. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Educators are increasingly using generative A.I. in their own work, even as they express profound hesitation about the ethics of student use.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Educators are increasingly using generative A.I. in their own work, even as they express profound hesitation about the ethics of student use. By Dana Goldstein As artificial intelligence makes its way into schools, a paradox is emerging. Many educators, concerned about cheating and shortcuts, are trying to limit student use of A.I. At the same time, teachers are increasingly using A.I. tools themselves, both to save time on rote tasks and to outsource some of their most meaningful work, like grading essays and tutoring struggling students. That tension has prompted some difficult ethical questions. For example, is it fair to use A.I. to grade student essays, if you’ve prohibited students from using A.I. to write them? School leaders are grappling with these dilemmas as they confront a barrage of marketing claims around how A.I. could “transform,” “personalize” and “accelerate” learning. A.I. “is already being used by the majority of teachers and students,” said Jennifer Carolan, a former history teacher and founder of Reach Capital, a venture capital firm that invests in A.I. learning tools. But as the technology works its way into schools, some educators say they are concerned that tech companies are pouring resources into A.I. applications, like tutoring bots, that disrupt the human relationships at the core of teaching and learning — instead of creating tools to ease the bureaucratic burdens that shift adults’ attention away from children.

"An Oval Office meeting between President Trump and President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador was a blunt example of Mr. Trump’s defiance of the federal courts.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by An Oval Office meeting between President Trump and President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador was a blunt example of Mr. Trump’s defiance of the federal courts. By Zolan Kanno-Youngs Reporting from Washington In an Oval Office meeting with President Trump on Monday, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador said that he would not return a Maryland man who was wrongly deported from the United States and sent to a notorious Salvadoran prison. Mr. Bukele, who has positioned himself as a key ally to Mr. Trump, in part by opening his country’s prisons to deportees, sat next to the president and a group of cabinet officials who struck a combative tone over the case, which has reached the Supreme Court. “Of course I’m not going to do it,” Mr. Bukele said when reporters asked if he was willing to help return the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old father of three who was deported last month. The Trump administration has acknowledged that his deportation was the result of an “administrative error.” The message from the meeting was clear: Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Bukele had any intention of returning Mr. Abrego Garcia, even though the Supreme Court has ruled that he should come back to the United States. The case has come to symbolize Mr. Trump’s defiance of the courts and his willingness to deport people without due process. Mr. Trump also mused about the possibility of sending American citizens convicted of violent crimes to prison in El Salvador, although he said Attorney General Pam Bondi was still studying the legality of the proposal. “If it’s a homegrown criminal, I have no problem, no,” Mr. Trump said. “I’m talking about violent people. I’m talking about really bad people.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"The Trump administration’s drive to slash and overhaul the government, led by Elon Musk, has already led to tens of thousands of departures.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Federal Layoffs Advertisement Supported by The Trump administration’s drive to slash and overhaul the government, led by Elon Musk, has already led to tens of thousands of departures. By Eileen Sullivan Reporting from Washington Federal agencies are facing a deadline on Monday to present their plans for another round of mass firings, the next step in the Trump administration’s drive to shrink the government that figures to further reshape a civil service that has endured tens of thousands of departures. Some agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, have already announced their layoffs for this round of dismissals, which follows the terminations in February of thousands of probationary federal employees. The cuts have come at the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the government overhaul initiative led by the tech billionaire Elon Musk. The group’s hard-charging effort has cast a pall over the federal work force since Mr. Trump returned to the Oval Office. This week’s plans for the mass firings, called “reductions in force,” should offer a clearer picture of the administration’s vision of a downsized federal government. Thousands of workers have also resigned voluntarily in recent days, accepting an offer to quit while temporarily being paid — including more than 1,100 people at the National Park Service, according to a person familiar with the details. The incentive applied only in certain departments as Monday’s deadline neared, and was originally pitched in January as a one-time offer. The Times has interviewed dozens of federal workers who have been fired or expect to be, as well as those who have watched co-workers disappear without any guidance on who would do their work. All spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. Since Jan. 20, agency supervisors and managers have largely been left in the dark about the personnel changes. Many have come to rely on the news media to learn about their job security, a scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency said. And scant information about the resignation and early retirement offers has left federal workers to seek advice on social media about whether to accept.

"The Republican former congressman, who was narrowly beaten by Elissa Slotkin in a marquee Senate matchup in 2024, hopes to fill the seat being vacated by Senator Gary Peters.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Republican former congressman, who was narrowly beaten by Elissa Slotkin in a marquee Senate matchup in 2024, hopes to fill the seat being vacated by Senator Gary Peters. By Taylor Robinson Former Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, announced on Monday that he would run for his state’s open U.S. Senate seat, his second bid for the chamber after losing to Senator Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat, by fewer than 20,000 votes last fall. The seat opened after Michigan’s senior senator, Gary Peters, a Democrat, said that he would not seek re-election to a third term. The race, in a battleground state that President Trump won in 2024 and Joseph R. Biden Jr. won in 2020, will help decide control of the Senate. It is expected to be among the most closely watched in next year’s midterm elections. In a video released by his campaign on Monday, Mr. Rogers said he would “stand with” the president and “deliver on the mandate given to him by the American people.” “Alongside President Trump,” Mr. Rogers said in the video, “I’ll fight to bring good, high-paying manufacturing jobs back to Michigan.” He added a “guarantee” that he would protect Social Security for older Americans. Mr. Rogers, 61, is a former F.B.I. special agent and Army officer who served in Congress for 14 years, including four as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He left Congress in 2015 to become a talk-radio host and eventually moved to Florida. His return to Michigan in 2023 failed to appease Democrats, who labeled him a disloyal opportunist in his race against Ms. Slotkin. That tightly fought contest, in which Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Rogers, was one of the last Senate races to be called in 2024. Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Republican majority leader, and Senator Tim Scott, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, both endorsed Mr. Rogers’s bid.

Aid agency employees have accused him of mismanagement.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","U.S.A.I.D. Advertisement Supported by Pete Marocco oversaw the cutting of thousands of contracts at U.S.A.I.D. and the firing of most of its roughly 10,000 workers. Aid agency employees have accused him of mismanagement. By Edward Wong Pete Marocco, who worked with Elon Musk’s team to oversee the gutting of foreign aid and the dismantling of the main U.S. aid agency, has left the State Department, administration officials said on Monday. The abrupt departure comes in the middle of the department’s efforts to merge the remnants of that aid group, the U.S. Agency for International Development, into the department by mid-August. Mr. Marocco had been acting as the head of foreign aid at the department and would have overseen the remaining aid operations, which amount to only a fraction of those active before President Trump took office. Mr. Marocco is expected to take another job in the administration, U.S. officials say. The State Department did not provide official comment on Mr. Marocco’s departure. But a statement from the department’s press office that was attributed to a “senior administration official” praised Mr. Marocco for finding “egregious abuses of taxpayer dollars” during his tenure. The statement provided no examples of such abuses. Mr. Marocco’s critics said they planned to continue scrutinizing how he and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have gutted foreign aid. “Pete Marocco’s tenure brought chaos to U.S.A.I.D., reckless and unlawful policy to the State Department, and dismantled longstanding U.S. foreign policy,” Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said in a statement, adding, “His actions deprived millions of people around the world of lifesaving aid and jeopardized U.S. credibility with our partners.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The opaque process, part of a strategy by conservatives to realign the liberal tilt of elite universities, has upended higher education. University leaders have been stunned by the swift assault, which many see as an attack on academic freedom aimed at crushing the influence of the elite institutions.Credit...New York Times Photographs By Sophie Park, Hiroko Masuike And Rachel Wisniewski Supported by By Michael C. BenderAlan Blinder and Jonathan Swan  As he finished lunch in the private dining room outside the Oval Office on April 1, President Trump floated an astounding proposal: What if the government simply canceled every dollar of the nearly $9 billion promised to Harvard University? The administration’s campaign to expunge “woke” ideology from college campuses had already forced Columbia University to strike a deal. Now, the White House was eyeing the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university. “What if we never pay them?” Mr. Trump casually asked, according to a person familiar with the conversation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private discussion. “Wouldn’t that be cool?” The moment underscored the aggressive, ad hoc approach continuing to shape one of the new administration’s most consequential policies. Mr. Trump and his top aides are exerting control of huge sums of federal research money to shift the ideological tilt of the higher education system, which they see as hostile to conservatives and intent on perpetuating liberalism. Their effort was energized by the campus protests against Israel’s response to the October 2023 terrorist attack by Hamas, demonstrations during which Jewish students were sometimes harassed. Soon after taking office, Mr. Trump formed the Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, which is scrutinizing leading universities for potential civil rights violations and serving as an entry point to pressure schools to reassess their policies.

By Alan Feuer Covers legal action surrounding President Trump’s deportation plans A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration on Monday night from using a powerful wartime statute to deport to El Salvador Venezuelan immigrants in Colorado who have been accused of being violent gang members. The lawsuit, brought in Federal District Court in Colorado by the American Civil Liberties Union, was the third of its kind filed in recent days, joining similar challenges filed last week in Texas and New York. Lawyers for the A.C.L.U. brought the suit on behalf of two men — known in court papers only by the their initials, D.B.U. and R.M.M. The men claim they have been wrongly accused by the administration of being members of the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua. In a later filing, the A.C.L.U. appeared to suggest that the administration might be preparing to deport additional migrants in Colorado, also accused of being affiliated with Tren de Aragua. Court papers say that D.B.U., 32, was arrested on Jan. 26 at a gathering that federal drug and immigration agents have repeatedly described as a Tren de Aragua party. After his arrest, the papers say, he denied being a member of the gang and has not been charged with any crime. Federal agents arrested R.M.M., 25, last month after they saw him standing with three other Hispanic men near their vehicles outside a residence in Colorado that was under surveillance as part of an investigation into Tren de Aragua, court papers said.

"County leaders said that layoffs of public workers were so far unlikely, but that the region’s financial challenges multiplied after the wildfires in January.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by County leaders said that layoffs of public workers were so far unlikely, but that the region’s financial challenges multiplied after the wildfires in January. By Shawn Hubler Reporting from Los Angeles Los Angeles County is facing a mounting financial crisis, its top manager said on Monday, as expected cuts in federal funding, a record $4 billion settlement for sex-abuse allegations and the destructive wildfires in January threaten Southern California’s economy. Fire-related costs are expected to approach $2 billion, Fesia Davenport, the county’s chief executive, said at a news briefing. The figure includes about $500 million in immediate costs plus lost revenue and recovery spending, and illustrates the lingering toll of the wildfires that began on Jan. 7, killing 30 people and destroying thousands of homes. One fire all but leveled the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in the City of Los Angeles’s jurisdiction, and another destroyed much of Altadena, also in the county’s jurisdiction. Last month, city officials projected a $1 billion budget shortfall for next year that stemmed from fire costs, legal liabilities and federal policy disruptions. City leaders said they were weighing steep budget cuts and possible layoffs. Los Angeles County is bigger than some states, with a population of nearly 10 million and more than 100,000 mostly unionized public employees. Ms. Davenport said that layoffs of county workers were so far unlikely, but that the region’s financial challenges had rapidly intensified. “The closest thing I can think of is Covid,” she told reporters, comparing the current budget woes to the coronavirus pandemic, which continues to impact the regional economy. Besides the costs of the wildfires, she said, the county also stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars or more in federal funds from policy changes in the Trump administration.

By The New York Times A former Colorado sheriff’s deputy was sentenced to three years in prison on Monday in the fatal shooting of a 22-year-old man who called 911 for help as he was experiencing a mental health crisis on a dark mountain road in 2022. In February, a jury found the former deputy, Andrew Buen, guilty of criminally negligent homicide after declining to convict him on the more serious charge of second-degree murder in the killing of Christian Glass. The case drew scrutiny of how the authorities handle crisis intervention, prompted changes to how officers are trained to handle similar situations and resulted in a $19 million settlement for Mr. Glass’s parents. Before the sentence was handed down, Mr. Buen, a former Clear Creek County sheriff’s deputy, addressed the judge and members of Mr. Glass’s family. “I wish I could take it all back, and it’s something I think about over and over,” he said through tears. “It’s my mistake that I took the life of Christian and I didn’t recognize that at the time, and it’s something I will always have to live with.” “Part of the reason I wanted to get into law enforcement,” he added, “was to change the negative view of law enforcement.

"Christopher J. Waller argued that the effect of tariffs on prices could be short-lived, but he warned about a bigger hit to growth.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","U.S. Economy Advertisement Supported by Christopher J. Waller argued that the effect of tariffs on prices could be short-lived, but he warned about a bigger hit to growth. By Colby Smith Tariffs of the magnitude that President Trump has enacted are poised to raise inflation in the United States. Whether it will be a temporary surge or one that spirals into a more serious problem is not yet clear, echoing a similar debate that bedeviled officials at the Federal Reserve during the coronavirus pandemic. Back then, the Fed initially billed the rise in inflation stemming from business shutdowns and supply chain snarls as “transitory,” an approach that led the central bank to be late in raising interest rates when it became clear that price pressures were persistent. One influential official at the Fed is reviving that view. In a speech on Monday, Christopher J. Waller laid out two scenarios that may play out for Mr. Trump’s tariffs, which the Fed governor described as “one of the biggest shocks to affect the U.S. economy in many decades.” How these levies impact both inflation and growth will impact how soon the Fed can again lower interest rates. If a recession appears to be taking shape, Mr. Waller said he would support the Fed cutting interest rates “sooner and to a greater extent” than initially expected. The first scenario Mr. Waller laid out assumes that the average tariff imposed on U.S. imports remains around its current level of 25 percent for an extended period. The second assumes a more modest 10 percent universal tariff, as other levies are removed over time. In both cases, Mr. Waller argued, the effects on inflation would not persist so long as expectations about future price pressures remained under control.

"Federal officials said they would freeze the money after Harvard said it would not submit to requests to overhaul hiring and report international students who break rules.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Federal officials said they would freeze the money after Harvard said it would not submit to requests to overhaul hiring and report international students who break rules. By Vimal Patel The Trump administration acted quickly on Monday to punish Harvard University after it refused to comply with a list of demands from the federal government that the school said were unlawful. On Monday afternoon, Harvard became the first university to refuse to comply with the administration’s requirements, setting up a showdown between the federal government and the nation’s wealthiest university. By the evening, federal officials said they would freeze $2.2 billion in multiyear grants to Harvard, along with a $60 million contract. Other universities have pushed back against the administration’s interference in higher education. But Harvard’s response, which called the Trump administration’s demands illegal, marked a major shift in tone for the nation’s most influential school, which has been criticized in recent weeks for capitulating to Trump administration pressure. A letter the Trump administration sent to Harvard on Friday demanded that the university reduce the power of students and faculty members over the university’s affairs; report foreign students who commit conduct violations immediately to federal authorities; and bring in an outside party to ensure that each academic department is “viewpoint diverse,” among other steps. The administration did not define what it meant by viewpoint diversity, but it has generally referred to seeking a range of political views, including conservative perspectives. A letter sent to Harvard on Friday by the Trump administration demanded that the university make a series of policy changes in order to continue to receive federal funding. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” said Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, in a statement to the university on Monday.

Emails over the last few days told them to leave or face deportation.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The Biden administration allowed 900,000 people to use an app to schedule appointments to cross the border. Emails over the last few days told them to leave or face deportation. By Miriam JordanJazmine Ulloa and Hamed Aleaziz Miriam Jordan reported from Los Angeles, Jazmine Ulloa and Hamed Aleaziz from Washington, D.C. Tens of thousands of immigrants who had been allowed to temporarily live and work in the United States under the Biden administration have received a seemingly unequivocal message in recent days from the Department of Homeland Security. Leave “immediately.” The termination notices, which started being delivered electronically last week, were more indication that migrants who followed the rules set by the last administration may be among the most vulnerable now as President Trump seeks to make good on his campaign promise of mass deportations. Many migrants who entered the country using the CBP One app — introduced in 2023 to bring order to the chaotic influx at the southwestern border — have been told their legal status would end seven days after the date on their notice. If they failed to depart voluntarily, they would be targeted for enforcement and deported, the notices said. “They believed they were following the right path by using the government-provided app,” said Joy Tucker, board chairwoman of Kaleidoscope Humanitarian Aid, a nonprofit organization in Tucson, Ariz. In a twist, at least 10 immigration lawyers, most of whom are U.S. citizens, said that they, too, had received the notices urging them to depart the country, possibly because of a glitch linking their email addresses to the immigration documents of their clients.

"President Trump’s aides have dug in on insisting that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia was lawfully sent to a prison in El Salvador after the administration had admitted to an “administrative error.”",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by President Trump’s aides have dug in on insisting that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia was lawfully sent to a prison in El Salvador after the administration had admitted to an “administrative error.” By Alan Feuer and Karoun Demirjian President Trump and his deputies are digging in on their refusal to heed a Supreme Court order to “facilitate” the release of a Maryland man who was deported to El Salvador last month despite another court order expressly forbidding him to be sent there. The administration has shifted from admitting in court filings that the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was deported because of an “administrative error,” to insisting that officials were right to send him and other migrants to a prison in El Salvador called CECOT, where detainees are cut off from the outside world and cannot meet with lawyers. Mr. Abrego Garcia has since been transferred to a different facility. The president’s deputies have repeatedly accused Mr. Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, which they have designated as a terrorist organization. On Friday, Mr. Trump held up a photo of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s tattooed hand in the Oval Office, arguing that the markings indicated he was a member of that gang. The sentiment has been echoed by President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, who visited Washington last week and said he would not return Mr. Abrego Garcia to the United States. The Justice Department has argued that it can take a passive approach to the Supreme Court’s demand that the administration “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release, doing little more than letting him into the United States if he manages to present himself to a port of entry.

"The Georgia congresswoman purchased at least tens of thousands of dollars in stock the day before and the day of President Trump’s pause of a sweeping set of tariffs that sent the market soaring.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The Georgia congresswoman purchased at least tens of thousands of dollars in stock the day before and the day of President Trump’s pause of a sweeping set of tariffs that sent the market soaring. By Annie Karni Reporting from Washington Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, disclosed on Monday that she had purchased between tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of stock on April 8 and 9, the day before and the day of President Trump’s announcement that he was pausing a sweeping set of global tariffs, a pivot that sent the stock market soaring out of a sizable slump. Ms. Greene bought between about $21,000 and $315,000 in stocks on those days. The day before Mr. Trump’s move, she also dumped between $50,000 and $100,0000 in Treasury bills, according to required public disclosures made to the House. The report came as Democrats in Congress have demanded investigations of whether the president’s whipsawing moves on trade might have been aimed at manipulating the market and giving his allies a lucrative opportunity for insider trading. Members of Congress are required to report their stock trades within 30 days of making them, though they only have to mark down broad ranges rather than specific dollar amounts. Ms. Greene’s April 8 and 9 trades — 21 each in the range of $1,001 to $15,000 — are some of the first among members of Congress that will be reported over the coming month as lawmakers detail their financial moves around the time the president encouraged people to buy the dip ahead of his pause on tariffs. “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” Mr. Trump wrote on social media the morning of April 9. About four hours later, he said he was pausing most tariffs on every country except China, an announcement that resulted in massive one-day gains in stocks. Ms. Greene, one of Mr. Trump’s most loyal allies in the House and an active stock trader, appeared to heed the advice, making an unusually large volume of stock purchases. That day, she bought stock in several companies, including Apple, which has since gone up in value by about 5 percent. She also bought stock in other technology companies, as well as energy firms such as Devon Energy Corporation and the pharmaceutical giant Merck & Company, according to her public disclosures.

"While political violence has not surged overall, a series of high-profile attempts on American leaders have shaken a public already worried about the country’s toxic political environment.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by While political violence has not surged overall, a series of high-profile attempts on American leaders have shaken a public already worried about the country’s toxic political environment. By Nick Corasaniti A charred piano. A singed light fixture dangling by a cord in a fire-scarred room. Plates strewn with ash, not far from a dinner table just cleared from a Passover Seder. The scorched rooms inside the official residence of Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania were the work of an arsonist who the authorities say admitted “harboring hatred” for Mr. Shapiro. Officials say the suspect revealed that if he found the governor, he planned to beat him with a hammer. The attack on Mr. Shapiro and his family was only the latest prominent attempt on the life of an American elected official. A string of violent outbursts in recent years has raised alarms about the threats lawmakers are confronting and the country’s often poisonous political environment. President Trump faced two assassination attempts last year, a bullet grazing his ear at a rally in Pennsylvania. A group of extremists planned to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. A man broke into Representative Nancy Pelosi’s home and assaulted her husband with a hammer. A gunman attacked Republican members of Congress as they practiced for a baseball game, wounding Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana. And the same weekend as the attack on Mr. Shapiro, an unsealed F.B.I. affidavit revealed that officials believe a 17-year-old in Wisconsin killed his mother and stepfather as part of a broader assassination plot against Mr. Trump. Yet while the attacks on top officials have rattled Americans in both parties, research shows that political violence overall is not necessarily on the rise. Large-scale eruptions — with the notable exception of the Trump-inspired riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — have not become more frequent. Support among Americans for acts of political violence like murder or arson remains exceedingly low, according to a weekly study conducted by the Polarization Research Lab at Dartmouth College.

"Four people were rescued on Sunday, two days after the boat capsized off the state’s Atlantic coast, the authorities said.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Four people were rescued on Sunday, two days after the boat capsized off the state’s Atlantic coast, the authorities said. By Remy Tumin Five migrants are feared dead after their boat capsized on the way to Florida from the Bahamas in “a suspected failed smuggling venture,” officials said on Monday. The U.S. Coast Guard said on Monday that it had suspended its search after covering 1,240 square miles over seven hours. Four people were rescued from a 25-foot vessel about 30 miles off Florida’s Atlantic Coast, near St. Lucie, on Sunday morning, according to the Coast Guard. Martin County Fire Rescue said in a statement that four survivors and one deceased victim were pulled from the water just before 10 a.m. Sunday. The Martin County Sheriff’s Department and the Coast Guard counted nine total passengers, but did not report the deceased victim reported by fire rescue officials. When asked, the sheriff, John Budensiek, was not aware of the death. One of the survivors was seriously injured and the others had injuries that were not life-threatening, fire rescue officials said. Sheriff Budensiek said at a news conference on Monday that the four people rescued were of Dominican and Haitian descent. According to interviews with survivors, the boat quickly capsized in the early hours of Friday when it left the island of Bimini, Sheriff Budensiek said. The Coast Guard said the boat capsized early Saturday morning. Many of the migrants were initially able to cling onto the boat but “lost their grip and one by one drifted out into the ocean,” he said. Only four were still alive — one woman and three men, including a 17-year-old — once the sheriff’s office was called around 8 a.m. on Sunday to assist the Coast Guard and U.S. Customs and Border Protection with the rescue operation, Sheriff Budensiek said. A fisherman who was out with his family on Sunday spotted the flipped vessel and was able to get close enough to give the migrants water, food and life jackets, the sheriff said. Because of rough sea conditions, his team needed over an hour to reach the boat. All four people who survived were transported to a hospital, where they were treated for water exposure and “serious sunburns,” Sheriff Budensiek said. The chance of recovering the remaining missing people “is probably pretty dismal at this point,” he said. “We believe they’re in the Gulf Stream, so they’re moving rapidly to the north.” “The decision to suspend a search is always difficult and never taken lightly,” Chief Warrant Officer Edgardo Insignares said in a Coast Guard statement. Smugglers “routinely exploit” vulnerable migrants for profit, he said, “while putting their lives at risk aboard overloaded and unseaworthy vessels.” Remy Tumin is a reporter for The Times covering breaking news and other topics.

"The bill, which applies to public and school libraries, is part of a national push by Republicans to crack down on content they consider inappropriate for children.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The bill, which applies to public and school libraries, is part of a national push by Republicans to crack down on content they consider inappropriate for children. By Mitch Smith North Dakota lawmakers narrowly passed a bill on Monday that would require most libraries in the state to keep material deemed sexually explicit in areas that are difficult for minors to access. Under the measure, librarians who do not comply could face prosecution. The legislation is part of a broader push by conservatives to restrict access to library books that they consider inappropriate for children, an effort that has alarmed many librarians and free speech advocates. New library laws or regulations have been approved in recent years in several Republican-led states, including Iowa, Idaho, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah. The North Dakota measure, which still must go to Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican, is the state’s latest effort to restrict library content. In 2023, former Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican, signed a measure that required explicit materials to be removed from the children’s sections of libraries. But Mr. Burgum, who is now secretary of the interior, vetoed a bill that would have imposed criminal penalties on librarians found guilty of willfully exposing minors to sexually explicit materials. The measure passed on Monday was somewhat less punitive. It gives librarians a 10-day period to remove materials that a local prosecutor finds to be obscene. Only if the librarian fails to comply during that period could they face criminal charges. The bill divided Republicans in the North Dakota House of Representatives, which voted 49 to 45 to pass it. Mike Nowatzki, a spokesman for Mr. Armstrong, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In legislative hearings, Republican supporters defended the bill as a way to protect children from inappropriate or harmful content. Some lawmakers cited examples of North Dakota libraries stocking materials with sexual themes and illustrations that they found offensive, and complained that librarians often failed to take parents’ complaints about books seriously.

Once again, the president used the gilded room as a place to flex his executive muscle while recasting the narrative around a consequential policy. President Trump with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador in the Oval Office on Monday.Credit...Eric Lee/The New York Times Supported by By Shawn McCreesh Shawn McCreesh is a White House correspondent. It was Monday in Washington, and the tension was palpable. Last week, the Supreme Court had ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to a maximum-security El Salvadoran prison. The stakes were high — both for Mr. Abrego Garcia, whose wife has begged for his return, and for the question of whether the White House would comply with the courts. Now, here was the answer, delivered from the Oval Office by a chorus of the administration’s top officials, as well as El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele (who once described himself as the world’s “coolest dictator”). There was Secretary of State Marco Rubio, squished on a couch between Vice President JD Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi. Susie Wiles, the president’s chief of staff, crowded in behind them, along with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller, the architect of much of the administration’s domestic policy. In the middle, center stage, was President Trump, sitting in a gold armchair. As the cameras rolled and reporters jostled, each figure jumped in to play their parts. Their lines did not always hew to the facts. “That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him,” Ms. Bondi said. “That’s not up to us.” “I don’t understand what the confusion is,” Mr. Rubio said. He added, “No court in the United States has a right to conduct a foreign policy of the United States. It’s that simple, end of story.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The Pentagon and defense contractors are heavily reliant on magnets and rare earth minerals mined or processed in China, which has suspended exports of the materials in an escalating trade war.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Pentagon and defense contractors are heavily reliant on magnets and rare earth minerals mined or processed in China, which has suspended exports of the materials in an escalating trade war. By Helene Cooper Reporting from Washington. On Air Force fighter jets, magnets made of rare earth minerals that are mined or processed in China are needed to start the engines and provide emergency power. On precision-guided ballistic missiles favored by the Army, magnets containing Chinese rare earth materials rotate the tail fins that allow missiles to home in on small or moving targets. And on new electric and battery-powered drones being adapted by Marines, rare earth magnets are irreplaceable in the compact electric motors. China’s decision to retaliate against President Trump’s sharp increase in tariffs by ordering restrictions on the exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets is a warning shot across the bow of American national security, industry and defense experts said. In announcing that it will now require special export licenses for six heavy rare earth metals, which are refined entirely in China, as well as rare earth magnets, 90 percent of which are produced in China, Beijing has reminded the Pentagon — if, indeed, it needed reminding — that a wide swath of American weaponry is dependent on China. “This decision is hugely consequential for our national security,” said Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Beijing, by beginning with what one Air Force official called a “heads-up” shot meant to signal how much more harm it could inflict should it choose, has left itself plenty of room to escalate. Beijing could also move on from the licensing restrictions to impose tariffs, quotas or even an all-out ban. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Why Elon Musk and his team have struggled to make the spending cuts they promised.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Advertisement Newsletter Why Elon Musk and his team have struggled to make the spending cuts they promised. By Jess Bidgood The way Elon Musk tells it, cutting government spending is easy. “If you add competence and caring, you’ll cut the budget deficit in half,” he declared in the Oval Office in February. Nearly three months in, though, Musk seems to be finding that there isn’t a silver bullet for his project, even in what he recently described as a “target-rich environment.” For all of the shock and awe of Musk’s efforts — with mass layoffs and the shuttering or hobbling of entire agencies — even the inflated figures of savings that he claims are falling well short of his goals. Musk has promised to cut $1 trillion from the next fiscal year’s federal budget by Sept. 30. At one point, he promised that his Department of Government Efficiency — a vehicle to shake up government that is not an actual department — would save $4 billion a day until then. Then last week, he seemed to revise that goal down to $150 billion, which is where DOGE puts its estimated savings on its website. He seemed to be moving the goal posts. My colleagues David Fahrenthold and Jeremy Singer-Vine report, though, that even that $150 billion figure may be more savings than the group can actually deliver. As they analyzed the group’s math, they noticed billion-dollar errors and claims of cutting spending that wasn’t actually planned for the next fiscal year — including the cancellation of a $318 million contract that did not yet exist. Phantom spending, if you will. What’s more, as Musk and his team look for cuts, my colleagues Alicia Parlapiano, Margot Sanger-Katz and Josh Katz point out, they have trained their attention on just one part of the government: nondefense discretionary spending. That part of the budget, which does not include spending on Social Security or Medicare, adds up to only $950 billion — so even if the Musk team cuts every dollar, it would still fall short. Musk is finding out what every government streamlining effort that came before him discovered: Shrinking government, and cutting its costs, are really hard.

"A man charged with setting fire to the residence of Gov. Josh Shapiro had faced previous charges of assaulting his family. He was arraigned on attempted murder and arson charges on Monday.",2025-04-14,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by A man charged with setting fire to the residence of Gov. Josh Shapiro had faced previous charges of assaulting his family. He was arraigned on attempted murder and arson charges on Monday. By Billy Witz and Campbell Robertson Reporting from Harrisburg, Penn. The man charged with attempted murder for setting fire to the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion while Gov. Josh Shapiro and his family slept had a troubled past and a history of mental illness, according to new details on the case that emerged on Monday. The police said the suspect in the case, Cody Balmer, 38, of Harrisburg, climbed an exterior fence outside the residence early Sunday morning, broke two windows with a hammer and threw Molotov cocktails inside, causing serious damage. He later told investigators that he had fashioned the incendiary devices from beer bottles and gasoline from a lawn mower. Francis T. Chardo, the Dauphin County district attorney, said that his office was still examining whether the attack was politically or religiously motivated and that investigators were looking at social media, voice mail and other records. The attack took place on the first night of Passover, a major Jewish holiday, several hours after the governor and his extended family had gathered for a Seder meal. Mr. Balmer, in an interview with the police, “admitted to harboring hatred” of Mr. Shapiro and said that he would have “beaten him with his hammer” had he run into him that night at the mansion, according to an affidavit filed in the case. But Mr. Balmer’s social media suggested not a particular ideology so much as a deep cynicism, in some posts espousing a libertarian bent bordering on anarchism, in others praising violence. His Facebook posts included rants about big pharma, women and the government. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

By Edward Wong and Karoun Demirjian The Trump administration could cut nearly 50 percent of the State Department’s funding next fiscal year, according to an internal memo laying out a downsizing plan being given serious consideration by department leaders, said two U.S. officials. The plan was drawn up as the White House pressures agencies to make significant budget cuts. The memo, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, proposes eliminating almost all funding for international organizations like the United Nations and NATO, ending the budget for supporting international peacekeeping operations and curtailing all of the department’s educational and cultural exchanges, like the Fulbright Program. It also proposes cutting funding for humanitarian assistance and global health programs by more than 50 percent despite Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s pledges that lifesaving assistance would be preserved. It was not clear if Mr. Rubio had endorsed the cuts outlined in the memo, which was dated April 10. Pete Marocco, who oversaw the gutting of government foreign aid programs before abruptly leaving the department, and Douglas Pitkin, who is in charge of the department’s budget planning, prepared the document. It was also not clear how seriously the proposed cuts would be entertained in Congress, which appropriates federal dollars. But, according to a U.S. official familiar with the department’s review, it is likely that the White House will send Congress a budget proposal this spring that is substantially similar to what the memo outlines in an effort to press lawmakers to formalize downsizing efforts that are already underway. Agencies are facing a deadline this week to submit detailed reorganization plans to the White House explaining what cuts they will make to help further shrink the federal government. While many departments have already announced or begun carrying out their planned cuts, the State Department has yet to publicly detail complete plans for downsizing.

"Jamison Wagner, 40, of Albuquerque, faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted, the authorities said.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Jamison Wagner, 40, of Albuquerque, faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted, the authorities said. By Neil Vigdor An Albuquerque man was arrested on Monday in connection with the fire bombings of the Republican Party of New Mexico’s headquarters in March and a Tesla dealership in February, attacks that the federal authorities have designated as “domestic terrorism.” The suspect, Jamison Wagner, 40, had parked his white Hyundai sedan at both locations before the arson attacks and then drove away, according to security and traffic camera images released by the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors said that surveillance footage from the Tesla showroom near Albuquerque on Feb. 9 showed him carrying a box of supplies that he used to spray-paint graffiti on the building and several vehicles. Investigators said that he had scrawled the phrases “Die Elon,” “Tesla Nazi Inc” and “Die Tesla Nazi,” references to the company’s billionaire founder, Elon Musk, who is leading the Trump administration’s cost-cutting program. Mr. Wagner was then observed breaking some car windows and throwing an incendiary device inside one of them, destroying it, a criminal complaint said. Several weeks after that arson attack, the authorities said, Mr. Wagner struck again, torching the lobby of the Republican Party of New Mexico’s headquarters during the early morning hours of March 30. Investigators say that he left behind critical evidence each time, connecting him to both crimes: lids from a jar of Smucker’s jelly and a container of olives that they said he had filled with gasoline. Both lids had the letter “H” or “I” written on them with what appeared to be a marker, photographs showed. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The vice president, a former senator from Ohio who graduated from Ohio State, joked about the mishap on social media.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The vice president, a former senator from Ohio who graduated from Ohio State, joked about the mishap on social media. By Alexandra E. Petri Vice President JD Vance dropped the College Football Playoff’s national championship trophy during an event on the White House South Lawn on Monday, an ill-timed fumble that he laughed about later after it had spread across social media. As the ceremony honoring the champion Ohio State Buckeyes came to an end, Mr. Vance — a former senator from Ohio who graduated from Ohio State — tried to lift the trophy, which was on a table onstage. TreVeyon Henderson, a Buckeyes running back, stepped in to help, grabbing the top of the trophy as Mr. Vance lifted the base. As the men hoisted it off the table, the trophy split in two and Mr. Vance dropped the base, which fell to the ground. Mr. Henderson and another player managed to hold onto the top of the trophy. According to the College Football Playoff website, the trophy consists of separate components — a 12-inch bronze base, and a 26-and-a-half-inch trophy made from 24-karat gold, bronze and stainless steel. Together, the pieces weigh 50 pounds, the Ohio State Athletic Department said on social media in January, three days after the Buckeyes defeated Notre Dame to win the title. After the base fell, some in the crowd gasped, while others laughed or clapped. Mr. Vance joked about the incident on social media. “I didn’t want anyone after Ohio State to get the trophy so I decided to break it,” Mr. Vance said. It was hardly the first championship trophy calamity. In 2006, after the tennis star Maria Sharapova won the U.S. Open, the top of the trophy popped off when she hoisted it above her head. (The announcer Dick Enberg called it her first unforced error of the night.) In 2011, as the soccer club Real Madrid celebrated its Copa del Rey victory over Barcelona, a player dropped the trophy from the upper level of an open double-decker bus, which ran over the cup and smashed it into pieces. And two years ago, at a ceremony after the Hungarian Grand Prix, the British racing driver Lando Norris slammed a bottle of sparkling wine on a table onstage, sending the trophy of the race winner, Max Verstappen, tumbling to the ground.

"The Biden-era program has allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti to enter the United States and work legally.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The Biden-era program has allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti to enter the United States and work legally. By Hamed Aleaziz Reporting from Washington A federal judge in Boston temporarily blocked the Trump administration on Monday from ending a signature Biden-era program that allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants from four troubled countries to enter the country and work legally. The administration moved in late March to shut down the program by April 24, which offered migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti temporary legal status in the United States. Judge Indira Talwani, of the Federal District Court in Boston, said the program’s termination put thousands of immigrants at imminent risk of deportation hearings once their legal status expires in less than two weeks. Judge Talwani blocked the wholesale shutdown of the program. Otherwise, she wrote in her ruling, the migrants would “be forced to choose between two injurious options: continue following the law and leave the country on their own, or await removal proceedings.” Immigrant advocates hailed the decision as a win for those worried about the imminent stripping of their status. “This ruling is a victory not just for our clients and those like them, but anyone who cherishes the freedom to welcome,” said Karen Tumlin, the director of the Justice Action Center, an immigrant advocacy group. “Our clients — and our class members — have done everything the government asked of them, and we’re gratified to see that the court will not allow the government to fail to uphold its side of the bargain.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The judge’s decision came as the Trump administration has moved to end legal protections for migrants from many countries, including by shutting down a program granting legal status to Afghan and Cameroonian migrants. A separate effort to revoke Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans in the United States was also blocked by a federal judge. The Biden-era program allowed more migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti to fly into the United States and stay temporarily with access to work permits if they had a financial sponsor and passed security checks. They were allowed to stay for up to two years. More than 500,000 migrants entered the country under the program. Biden officials said it was part of an effort to deter migrants from those countries from crossing into the country illegally, and encourage a legal pathway instead. Trump officials, announcing the move to end the program last month, said the program added to immigration problems in the United States by granting some protections to “a substantial population of aliens in the interior of the United States without a clear path to a durable status.” Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy.

The White House will soon move to rapidly repeal or freeze rules that affect health, food, workplace safety, transportation and more. Credit...By Kendrick Brinson, William Widmer, Tamir Kalifa, Karsten Moran, Christopher Capozziello, Scott McIntyre and Brittany Greeson For The New York Times Supported by By Coral Davenport At the Department of Health and Human Services, Trump administration officials want to reverse a regulation that has required nursing homes to have more medical staff on duty. At the Mine Safety and Health Administration, powerful lobbying groups have asked the administration to eliminate a rule to protect miners from inhaling the dust of crystalline silica, a mineral that is used in concrete, smartphones and cat litter but that can be lethal in the lungs. And at the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates radio and television broadcasting and satellite communications, President Trump’s appointees published a seemingly exuberant notice asking for suggestions on which rules to get rid of, titled “DELETE, DELETE, DELETE.” Across the more than 400 federal agencies that regulate almost every aspect of American life, from flying in airplanes to processing poultry, Mr. Trump’s appointees are working with the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative headed by Elon Musk and also called DOGE, to launch a sweeping new phase in their quest to dismantle much of the federal government: deregulation on a mass scale. Usually, the legal process of repealing federal regulations takes years — and rules erased by one administration can be restored by another. But after chafing at that system during his first term and watching President Joseph R. Biden Jr. enact scores of new rules pushed by the left, Mr. Trump has marshaled a strategy for a dramatic do-over designed to kill regulations swiftly and permanently. At Mr. Trump’s direction, agency officials are compiling the regulations they have tagged for the ash heap, racing to meet a deadline next week after which the White House will build its master list to guide what the president called the “deconstruction of the overbearing and burdensome administrative state.” The Times would like to hear about your experience as a federal worker under the second Trump administration.

A date? The birders who look after her just want her to go home. By Yan Zhuang On Roosevelt Island, she had her home, her friends and the security of a small community where everyone knew her. Cars slowed down for her. Residents helped her cross the road. But that wasn’t enough, it seems. Like so many before her, she flew the coop, lured across the East River by the bright lights and glamour of Midtown Manhattan. Was she seeking excitement? Danger? A date? Astoria, the wild turkey who rose to fame last year when she unexpectedly appeared in Midtown, visiting luxury retailers, dining at high-end restaurants and roosting on Park Avenue, returned to Midtown East on Sunday. Over the past two days, she has had some wild adventures: She has roosted in trees and on balconies, foraged in flower beds and fled from dogs. She even had a run-in with the police. Her movements have delighted and captivated New Yorkers, even as a bevy of dedicated bird-watchers have worried about her safety. As of early Tuesday, she was still living the high life. She was last seen on Monday night roosting on a balcony around 58th Street, between First Avenue and Sutton Place, said David Barrett, a birder who runs the Manhattan Bird Alert account on X and helps look after Astoria. Birders say Astoria probably crossed the East River to look for love. In the days before setting off for Midtown, she had strayed to parts of Roosevelt Island, a residential neighborhood in the East River, where she didn’t usually go, and had been calling out, Mr. Barrett said. “When you put that together with the fact that it’s mating season for wild turkeys, we figured that she’s looking for a mate.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The vice president did not offer details, but his comments may offer British leaders some comfort after the Trump administration imposed tariffs.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The vice president did not offer details, but his comments may offer British leaders some comfort after the Trump administration imposed tariffs. By Mark Landler Reporting from London Vice President JD Vance predicted that President Trump would make a trade deal with Britain, a country “he really loves,” a comforting sign for a British government that was stung to be placed under a 10 percent tariff by Mr. Trump. “He admires and loves the king. It is a very important relationship,” Mr. Vance said in an interview published on Tuesday by a British news and opinion website, UnHerd, referring to King Charles III. Mr. Vance said the White House was working closely with Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain and his government. “I think there’s a good chance that, yes, we’ll come to a great agreement that’s in the best interest of both countries,” he said. Mr. Vance did not go into the details of a potential deal, which are complicated and politically charged in Britain. The country is one of many lining up for talks with the United States since Mr. Trump imposed across-the-board tariffs on dozens of countries, and much larger levies on China. A senior British official said last week that he believed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent would focus initially on an agreement with Japan, the fourth-largest trading partner of the United States, after Canada, Mexico and China. The European Union has the largest trading volume with the United States overall, but it is not viewed as a priority in the same way as those other countries. Still, Mr. Vance softened his tone toward Europe after an acrimonious stretch in which he scolded European leaders, appeared to endorse far-right parties like Alternative for Germany, or AfD, and disparaged the armed forces of Britain and France, both of which fought alongside American troops in Afghanistan.

"A video from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park taken during an earthquake put complex elephant herd dynamics on display.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Earthquakes Advertisement Supported by A video from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park taken during an earthquake put complex elephant herd dynamics on display. By Jonathan Wolfe The 5.2 magnitude earthquake that shook Southern California on Monday may have provoked a collective shrug from humans in the region, but a few elephants north of San Diego took the tremor very seriously. A video taken at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in Escondido, Calif., shows the action unfold: Five African elephants are basking in the morning sun until the camera begins to shake and a tremor sends the animals scrambling toward one another. A few moments later, almost in unison, the elephants form a tight circle, with the older elephants surrounding the younger calves. The herd remains in formation through the end of the video, facing outward with ears extended, as if on high alert for threats. The earthquake, which struck around 10 a.m. on Monday, had its epicenter near Julian, Calif., about 60 miles northeast of San Diego. There were no reports of injuries or damage, according to the San Diego County Sheriff’s Office. The response from the elephants was a defensive position known as “bunching,” and is a typical reaction to threats, said Joyce Poole, a conservation biologist with a doctorate in elephant behavior from Cambridge University. “They feel more secure when they are close together,” she said. When bunched, elephants often have their tusks pointed out, ears extended, eyes open wide and trunks out, trying to smell potential threats. The formation, “like the spokes of a wheel,” Dr. Poole said, gives the group a 360-degree view of their surroundings to pinpoint any danger. The younger members instinctively seek out the most protected position inside the circle, she said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Harvard has rejected an effort by the White House to exert more control over its programs. Federal law prohibits the president from telling the I.R.S. to conduct specific tax investigations.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Harvard has rejected an effort by the White House to exert more control over its programs. Federal law prohibits the president from telling the I.R.S. to conduct specific tax investigations. By Tyler PagerAndrew DuehrenMaggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan Reporting from Washington President Trump threatened Harvard University’s tax-exempt status on Tuesday after the school rebuffed his administration’s demands for a series of policy changes, a dramatic escalation in the feud between the president and the nation’s richest and oldest university. The threat came a day after the Trump administration halted more than $2 billion in federal funding for Harvard because the university rejected changes to its hiring and admissions practices and curriculum. Mr. Trump decided to ratchet up his pressure campaign after watching news coverage of Harvard’s resistance on Monday night, according to a person with knowledge of the president’s deliberations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. “Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’” Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social on Tuesday morning. “Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!” White House officials said Tuesday that the Internal Revenue Service would make its decision about Harvard’s tax-exempt status independently, but the president has made clear in private that he has no intention of backing down from the fight with the university. Losing its tax-exempt status could over time cost Harvard billions of dollars. It’s the latest turn in a battle between Mr. Trump and academia more broadly, in which the Trump administration threatened to withhold billions in federal funding from various colleges and universities, ostensibly as a way to purge “woke” ideology from America’s college campuses. Trump officials have suggested that schools like Harvard have been hotbeds of antisemitism, elitism and suppression of free speech. Federal law prohibits the president from “directly or indirectly” telling the I.R.S. to conduct specific tax investigations, and it is unclear whether the agency would actually move forward with an investigation.

"Fire departments say prices for new engines have soared and orders are backlogged for years. Two senators are investigating whether investors who have disrupted the industry are the reason.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Fire departments say prices for new engines have soared and orders are backlogged for years. Two senators are investigating whether investors who have disrupted the industry are the reason. By Mike Baker As fire departments around the country report soaring prices and waiting times for new fire engines, two United States Senators are investigating the effect on public safety and the role that private equity investment has played in disrupting the firefighting equipment industry. The senators — Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Jim Banks, Republican of Indiana — reported on Tuesday that they had heard from dozens of fire departments about delayed deliveries, defective parts and escalating prices. In a letter to the International Association of Fire Fighters, they said they were concerned that “private equity is padding shareholders’ wallets at the expense of public safety” and that they were seeking to learn more about the situation. Over the past two decades, the private equity firm American Industrial Partners has acquired a number of specialty vehicle companies, including fire truck manufacturers, and has combined them into a single company called Rev Group. Company executives told analysts that they would substantially raise profit margins and that other companies were doing the same. Rev Group closed two manufacturing plants to streamline its operations. The New York Times reported earlier this year that prices for fire trucks have soared in recent years and that manufacturers are taking longer to deliver vehicles. Rev Group has said it has a backlog of $4 billion in orders. Industry leaders have said that the delays and rising prices stemmed from disruptions brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, but some fire officials have blamed the problems at least partly on the industry’s consolidation. Sue Finkam, the mayor of Carmel, Ind., said she raised the issue with Mr. Banks after she saw how quickly prices for new trucks were rising and how long they would take to be delivered. The estimated price of a new pumper vehicle rose about 10 percent in 2024 from the previous year, she said, while the wait time for a new tiller apparatus is now more than four years.

By Andrew Duehren and Eileen Sullivan Reporting from Washington About 22,000 employees at the Internal Revenue Service have signed up for the Trump administration’s latest resignation offer, according to four people familiar with the matter, an exodus that could weaken the agency’s ability to collect taxes. The I.R.S. had about 100,000 employees before President Trump took office. Roughly 5,000 employees have resigned since January, and an additional 7,000 probationary employees were laid off, though those firings have been contested in court. If those layoffs take effect, the agency would be on track to lose about a third of its work force this year. Under the terms of the Trump administration’s deferred resignation offer, employees who take the deal will be put on paid administrative leave through September and then leave their federal jobs. Some employees who took the offer could still opt out of resigning. Losing a third of I.R.S. staff — with remaining employees bracing for further layoffs and funding cuts — is expected to decrease the amount of revenue the federal government is able to collect. The cuts have already caused the I.R.S. to abandon some audits, current and former employees said, and taxpayers may feel more emboldened to try and avoid paying taxes if the I.R.S. is diminished. The Biden administration had expanded the I.R.S. by about 20,000 employees in hopes of increasing the amount of tax revenue it collected. A Treasury spokesperson said the department was aiming to reverse the hirings from the last administration and still improve service. “The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy and customer service the American people deserve,” the spokesperson for Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said. Among the resigning I.R.S. officials is the acting commissioner, Melanie Krause. She and other top I.R.S. officials decided to leave the agency in part because of an agreement to share taxpayer information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Trump administration’s decision to use I.R.S. data to help deport undocumented immigrants has caused widespread concern at the tax collector, which has long kept taxpayer information confidential.

"Shelby Park in Eagle Pass, Texas, was a backdrop for immigration fights during the Biden administration, but as the battle has moved inland some of the state’s troops have decamped.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Shelby Park in Eagle Pass, Texas, was a backdrop for immigration fights during the Biden administration, but as the battle has moved inland some of the state’s troops have decamped. By Edgar Sandoval Reporting from Eagle Pass, Texas On Monday morning, as temperatures rose toward sweltering, Dora Flores warily approached the entrance of a modest park in the border city of Eagle Pass, Texas, wanting to see for herself whether the armed guards and concertina wire that had kept residents out for over a year had actually disappeared. “Is the park really open?” Ms. Flores, 73, wondered aloud. “This used to look like a jail.” The sudden reopening of Shelby Park in Eagle Pass this month was another sign of the changing of the guard in Washington, D.C., being felt far, far beyond the Beltway. In the last year, the large but humble tract along the U.S.-Mexican border had served as a backdrop for political fights. Republicans had used it to showcase the “invasion” of migrants. Democrats converged to decry what they saw as overly aggressive immigration tactics. In January 2024, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas took it over in a show of force, castigating the border policies of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. while keeping people like Ms. Flores away. In recent days, to the relief of local residents, Shelby Park — with its soccer and baseball fields and a boat ramp into the Rio Grande — has become just a park again, almost. Citing record-low crossings, the state of Texas has quietly abandoned the park gates, rolled up most of the concertina wire there and left only a small crew by the river. “We’re happy the park has returned to the city,” said the town’s mayor, Rolando Salinas Jr. The semblance of normalcy underscores how the battle over immigration has migrated inland, to street corners of university towns, Democratic-led cities far from the southern border and courtrooms all over the country — as well as one enormous prison in El Salvador. During the height of the immigration surge under Mr. Biden — when more than 1,000 migrants were crossing a day — Eagle Pass became ground zero for testing Texas’ limit in enforcing immigration law.

"President Trump says he is powerless to retrieve a man who was deported because of an administrative error. But he has done so before.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by President Trump says he is powerless to retrieve a man who was deported because of an administrative error. But he has done so before. By Hamed Aleaziz Reporting from Washington Follow live updates on the Trump administration here. In August 2018, during President Trump’s first term, an Iraqi immigrant named Muneer Subaihani went missing. A refugee who had been living in the United States for nearly 25 years, Mr. Subaihani was among hundreds of Iraqis who had been protected from deportation under a federal court order. His lawyers figured he was still in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, where he had been placed after he was swept up in an ICE raid. A search of the federal ICE database turned up nothing, so the attorneys went to the Justice Department, looking for an answer. Within a day, they got one. The government said it had made a mistake, according to Margo Schlanger, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School who was one of Mr. Subaihani’s lawyers. Mr. Subaihani had been deported to Iraq, in violation of the court order. The case has striking similarities to one that is playing out now in Mr. Trump’s second term, after the United States deported a Salvadoran man because of what the government has acknowledged was an “administrative error.” But the Trump administration’s response in the two cases could not be more different, a sign of how emboldened Mr. Trump has become in his defiance of the courts and in his determination to take a hard line on deportations, regardless of legal constraints.

"It’s the latest setback to the president’s efforts to wield government power to punish law firms. A federal judge called it “a shocking abuse of power.”",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by It’s the latest setback to the president’s efforts to wield government power to punish law firms. A federal judge called it “a shocking abuse of power.” By Zach Montague Reporting from Washington A federal judge on Tuesday blocked President Trump from punishing the law firm Susman Godfrey, calling the retribution campaign he has waged from the White House against the nation’s top firms “a shocking abuse of power.” Ruling from the bench, Judge Loren L. AliKhan of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia said that the executive order Mr. Trump signed last week targeting the firm stemmed from a “personal vendetta.” Susman Godfrey represented Dominion, a manufacturer of voting machines that lawyers allied with Mr. Trump falsely attacked when he lost the 2020 election; the firm helped Dominion secure a $787.5 million settlement in a defamation case against Fox News. The judge’s decision temporarily blocks the Trump administration from carrying out many of the order’s punishments, including one directing agencies to turn the firm’s lawyers away from federal buildings and another aimed at terminating any federal contracts Susman Godfrey holds. It is the latest legal setback for Mr. Trump in his efforts to cripple firms he has accused of helping “weaponize” the justice system against him. The president’s actions have split the legal elite, with some high-powered firms bowing to pressure from the White House and offering hundreds of millions of dollars worth of pro bono work on issues Mr. Trump supports. Others, like Susman Godfrey, have opted to fight back. In a statement after the decision, the firm said it was “duty bound” to push back given the stakes involved. “This fight is bigger and more important than any one firm,” the statement said. Judges elsewhere have issued temporary orders blocking much of Mr. Trump’s executive orders targeting two major law firms that participated in investigations of him, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale. A judge also halted an order aimed at Perkins Coie, which was involved in a dossier compiled during the 2016 campaign about Mr. Trump’s potential ties to Russia. Perkins Coie was the first firm to challenge Mr. Trump’s moves in court. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"The judge also said she planned to force Trump officials to reveal what they have done behind the scenes to seek the return of the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The judge also said she planned to force Trump officials to reveal what they have done behind the scenes to seek the return of the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. By Alan Feuer Reporting from Greenbelt, Md. Follow live updates on the Trump administration here. A federal judge scolded the Trump administration on Tuesday for dragging its feet in complying with a Supreme Court order that directed the White House to “facilitate” the release of a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador last month. “To date nothing has been done,” the judge, Paula Xinis, told a lawyer for the Justice Department. “Nothing.” The stern words came during a hearing in Federal District Court in Maryland, where Judge Xinis said that she intended to force Trump officials to answer questions — both in writing and in depositions — about what they had done so far to get the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, out of the prison. Noting that every passing day was another that Mr. Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old father of three, suffered harm in Salvadoran custody, the judge set up a fast schedule for officials to provide documents and sit for depositions. “We’re going to move,” she said. “There will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding.” The hearing came only one day after President Trump said at an Oval Office news conference that he was powerless in seeking Mr. Abrego Garcia’s freedom. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, sitting beside Mr. Trump, said he had no intention of releasing the man. The case of Mr. Abrego Garcia, a sheet metal worker the Trump administration accused of being a member of the violent street gang MS-13, has emerged in recent days as yet another flashpoint in Mr. Trump’s aggressive plans to deport immigrants the government has deemed to be criminals, even if there is little evidence to support its claims.

By Julian E. Barnes Reporting from Washington All of the messages from a leaked group chat have been deleted from the phone of John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, the agency said in a court filing. Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, created a chat group and invited cabinet members and their aides to discuss the administration’s plans to strike Houthi militia targets in Yemen last month. But Mr. Waltz inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, who eventually published the texts. Democrats and other critics have said that the officials in the chat on the commercial app Signal revealed classified and sensitive information, including the times U.S. airstrikes were being launched from ships. Testifying before Congress last month, Mr. Ratcliffe and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, said that the information was not classified. The watchdog group American Oversight said the messages were federal records and sued in an effort to preserve the chats. In court papers filed on Monday, Hurley V. Blankenship, the C.I.A.’s chief data officer, declared that he had reviewed screenshots from Mr. Ratcliffe’s account. But he said only “residual administrative content” remained, including the name of the chat, the “Houthi PC small group.” “The screenshot,” Mr. Blankenship said, “does not include substantive messages from the Signal chat.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Even a few seconds’ notice gives people time to prepare before the shaking.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Earthquakes Advertisement Supported by Even a few seconds’ notice gives people time to prepare before the shaking. By Amy Graff Amy Graff is a reporter on The Times’s weather team. Millions of people across Southern California learned about a 5.2-magnitude earthquake that hit San Diego County on Monday not from their windows rattling or their picture frames clattering, but from a noisy alert on their mobile phones seconds before the shaking started. The urgent messages — advising people to “drop, cover, hold on. Protect yourself” — were created with a tool from the United States Geological Survey known as ShakeAlert. The system detects earthquakes as soon as they start happening and quickly gathers information to determine which areas are likely to experience strong shaking. ShakeAlert operates on the notion that each and every fraction of a second is precious time that people can use to react and avoid injury before shaking from an earthquake occurs. Here’s how the system works: The ShakeAlert early warning system monitors for earthquakes across the West Coast with the help of tens of thousands of seismic stations, each the size of a compact car and buried about six feet underground. The stations are equipped with sensors that detect the full spectrum of seismic waves, the vibrations that travel through the Earth and toward the surface after an earthquake, similar to the way ripples radiate across water when a pebble is dropped into a lake. The waves travel at different speeds, and the success of the system is built on this. The fast-moving primary waves, or P-waves, travel at about four miles per second; they are gentler and less likely to cause destruction. The stronger secondary waves, or S-waves, move much more slowly, about two and a half miles per second. They are more likely to cause damage in an earthquake. The goal of ShakeAlert is to capture the P-wave data, process it on the U.S.G.S.’s high-speed computers and make it available to government agencies and private companies like apps that send out alerts before the S-waves hit the surface. “It’s all automated, and it’s all happening really fast,” said Robert de Groot, a physical scientist at the agency and a coordinator for ShakeAlert.

"The House of Representatives went on recess without acting on a measure to avert a possible billion-dollar budget cut in Washington, D.C.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The House of Representatives went on recess without acting on a measure to avert a possible billion-dollar budget cut in Washington, D.C. By Campbell Robertson The mayor of Washington, D.C., ordered citywide spending and hiring freezes on Tuesday and raised the possibility of furloughs after the U.S. House of Representatives left for recess with the District still facing a potential billion-dollar budget cut. The order does not lay out specific cuts, but it paves the way for possible steep reductions to city services if Congress does not act in the next few weeks. The budget crunch is not the only challenge the District has been wrestling with since Republicans took full control of the federal government. Mass layoffs of federal workers are projected to cost the city a billion dollars in lost revenue over the next three years. At the same time, President Trump and multiple Republican lawmakers have threatened to strip the city of its local government entirely. But the looming budget emergency has been particularly frustrating to local officials, who believe it reflects a basic misunderstanding of how the city’s budget works. In the resolution that Congress passed in March to fund the federal government for another six months, the budgets of all federal agencies were frozen at the level of the 2024 fiscal year. But in a departure from decades of practice, the House’s resolution did not exempt the District from that freeze, even though the budget funds being frozen were locally raised tax revenues, not federal dollars. The effect would be a $1.1 billion cut in anticipated spending, made all the more difficult because the District is already halfway through the current fiscal year. District officials lobbied lawmakers for a fix, and after approving the funding resolution, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a bill sparing the District’s budget. With President Trump himself explicitly endorsing the bill, the odds seemed to suggest that the threat to D.C. would be headed off. But weeks passed and the House did not act, with some lawmakers hoping to add on amendments pertaining to matters like abortion and cannabis that could hinder any chance of quick passage.

"Two aides to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were escorted from the Pentagon on Tuesday, and the chief of staff to the deputy defense secretary was removed on Wednesday.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Two aides to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were escorted from the Pentagon on Tuesday, and the chief of staff to the deputy defense secretary was removed on Wednesday. By Greg Jaffe and John Ismay Reporting from Washington Two top advisers to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth were escorted from the Pentagon on Tuesday and a third official followed on Wednesday as part of an investigation into an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, U.S. defense officials said. Dan Caldwell and Darin Selnick, who were identified as part of a continuing leak investigation, were placed on administrative leave on Tuesday, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. On Wednesday, Colin Carroll, the chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Stephen A. Feinberg, was removed from the Pentagon immediately after an interview with investigators in his office, according to another official. Since arriving at the Pentagon with Mr. Hegseth in January, Mr. Caldwell has accompanied the defense secretary to some of his meetings with major foreign leaders. In a Signal text chain first disclosed by The Atlantic last month, Mr. Caldwell was listed as Mr. Hegseth’s representative to the White House as it prepared to launch strikes in Yemen. He also advised Mr. Hegseth on other matters related to U.S. military operations around the world. The investigation into Mr. Caldwell and his removal from the Pentagon were reported earlier by Reuters. The suspensions of Mr. Selnick and Mr. Carroll were reported earlier by Politico. Mr. Selnick has worked closely with Mr. Hegseth on personnel matters and the enforcement of President Trump’s order banning any content related to diversity, equity and inclusion from the Defense Department. He was widely seen inside the Pentagon as one of Mr. Hegseth’s and Mr. Trump’s most loyal enforcers of policy. He had little to do with matters of international relations or foreign policy, which were Mr. Caldwell’s focus. The dismissals seem to be connected to a broader power struggle within Mr. Hegseth’s office, rather than a specific leak, according to several people with close ties to the Trump administration.

"The Iowa Republican was pressed on President Trump’s policies, including the case of a Salvadoran immigrant who his administration has admitted it mistakenly sent to a prison in El Salvador.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Iowa Republican was pressed on President Trump’s policies, including the case of a Salvadoran immigrant who his administration has admitted it mistakenly sent to a prison in El Salvador. By Michael Gold Reporting from Fort Madison, Iowa Angry constituents on Tuesday confronted Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, about President Trump’s refusal to bring back a Salvadoran immigrant mistakenly sent to a prison in El Salvador. In the most heated exchange of an hourlong town hall in the Southeast corner of his state, Mr. Grassley, 91, was asked by a shouting audience member whether he would do anything to help secure the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was deported last month. Mr. Grassley had been responding to another questioner’s criticisms of the Trump administration’s stance toward refugees when a man behind her shouted: “ Are you going to bring that guy back from El Salvador?” The question was met with enthusiastic claps from many in the crowd of about 100. “I’m not going to,” Mr. Grassley said. Pressed to explain his stance, he added, “Because that’s not a power of Congress.” When the man replied that the Supreme Court had ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release, others in the audience began piling on. Some noted that Mr. Grassley chairs the Judiciary Committee, which oversees immigration policy and judges, prompting the senator to stammer, then fall silent and wait for the shouting to die down before trying to respond. “El Salvador is an independent country,” Mr. Grassley said. “The president of that country is not subject to our U.S. Supreme Court.” The crowd practically erupted in jeers. The discussion was representative of the tone throughout the town hall, a standing-room-only event in Fort Madison, Iowa, in which the eight-term senator was repeatedly pressed about why he was not doing more to rein in the Trump administration. Though at least two members of the crowd wore shirts suggesting they supported the president, Mr. Grassley often struggled to be heard over his audience. They peppered him with questions about Mr. Trump’s tariffs, his sweeping immigration policies, massive cuts to the federal government and the future of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. At one point, Mr. Grassley was asked directly whether he was “proud of Trump.” “There’s no president I have agreed with 100 percent of the time,” he answered. The crowd responded with groans.

"A departmental memo describes paring back the American diplomatic presence on every continent.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by A departmental memo describes paring back the American diplomatic presence on every continent. By Karoun Demirjian Reporting from Washington The Trump administration is considering plans to close 10 embassies and 17 consulates and reduce or consolidate the staff of several other foreign missions, according to an internal State Department memo viewed by The New York Times. The closures and other reductions outlined in the document, which is undated, would pare back the American presence on nearly every continent. They represent an expansion of plans the Trump administration was working on earlier this year for closing a dozen foreign missions and laying off local staff who work in those locations. The cuts are in keeping with President Trump’s plans to reduce federal spending across the government, as well as a proposal that State Department leaders have been considering to cut nearly 50 percent of the department’s spending. But the new proposed reductions have raised fresh concerns that the United States will be ceding vital diplomatic space to China, including in areas of the world where Washington has a greater presence than Beijing, compromising American national security, including intelligence gathering. Six of the embassies that the memo proposed for closure are in Africa: Central African Republic, Eritrea, Gambia, Lesotho, the Republic of Congo and South Sudan. The memo recommends transferring their functions to embassies in nearby countries. The memo also recommends closing two small embassies in Europe — in Luxembourg and Malta — as well as the diplomatic missions in Grenada and the Maldives, and moving their portfolios to nearby countries, too. Most of the consulates that are recommended for closure are in Europe, and they include several tourist destinations popular with Americans. Five of the consulates are in France — in Bordeaux, Lyon, Marseilles, Rennes and Strasbourg. Two are in Germany — in Düsseldorf and Leipzig. Another two, Mostar and Banja Luka, are in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The memo also suggests closing consulates in Thessaloniki, Greece; Florence, Italy; Ponta Delgada, Portugal; and Edinburgh. Outside of Europe, the memo recommends closing an additional four consulates, in Douala, Cameroon; Medan, Indonesia; Durban, South Africa; and Busan, South Korea. The memo also suggests either significantly downsizing or eliminating the U.S. embassy presence in Mogadishu, Somalia, and closing the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Center in Iraq, while reducing costs at the diplomatic posts in Baghdad and Erbil, Iraq. It also suggests consolidating consular support in countries with multiple consulates — such as Japan and Canada — in a single location. If enacted, the proposed cuts would mean that the United States would have less of a diplomatic presence than China in Europe, where American outposts currently outnumber Chinese ones, according to data compiled by the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy think tank in Sydney. It would also mean that the United States would fall further behind China’s presence in Africa and East Asia, where Chinese missions currently outnumber American ones.

"Schools run by the Defense Department removed books and made other changes in response to orders from President Trump and his secretary of defense.",2025-04-15,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Schools run by the Defense Department removed books and made other changes in response to orders from President Trump and his secretary of defense. By Sarah Mervosh The American Civil Liberties Union sued the Department of Defense’s education agency on Tuesday, arguing that the removal of books in response to Trump administration orders infringed on the First Amendment rights of students. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia, centers on a school system for children of military families run by the Defense Department. The school system has faced pushback and student walkouts in response to a number of changes under the Trump administration, including the pausing of student affinity clubs focused on race and gender and the removal of Pride decorations at some schools. The schools, which routinely produce some of the top reading and math scores in the country, educate more than 67,000 students in preschool through high school on military bases in the United States and abroad. Because Defense Department schools are run by the federal government, they have been uniquely subject to President Trump’s executive orders on education, such as an order “ending radical indoctrination in K-12 schooling” that criticized teaching about concepts like white privilege and rejected policies supporting transgender students’ preferred pronouns and bathrooms, for example. Mr. Trump’s secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, also called for an end to cultural awareness months in the military, such as those for Black history or women’s history, a change that applied to its schools.

"The Trump administration started with a simple goal: Make Iran dismantle its nuclear and missile programs. Then its top negotiator started softening his tone, and had to retreat.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by News Analysis The Trump administration started with a simple goal: Make Iran dismantle its nuclear and missile programs. Then its top negotiator started softening his tone, and had to retreat. By David E. Sanger David E. Sanger, who covers the White House and national security, has reported on the Iranian nuclear program for more than two decades. He reported from Washington. Just a few weeks ago, President Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, a longtime hawk on Iran, cast the administration’s goal in negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program in crystal clear terms. “Full dismantlement,” he said. He went on to list what that meant: Iran had to give up facilities for enriching nuclear fuel, for “weaponization” and even its long-range missiles. But what sounded like a simple, tough-sounding goal on a Sunday talk show has started to unravel. In the past 24 hours, officials have left a contradictory and confusing set of messages, suggesting the administration might settle for caps on Iran’s activities — much as President Barack Obama did a decade ago — before backtracking on Tuesday. Some of this may simply reflect inexperience in dealing with nuclear weapons programs. Mr. Trump’s chief negotiator is Steve Witkoff, a friend of the president’s who, as a New York developer like him, has spent a lifetime dealing with skyscrapers but only began delving into Iran’s underground nuclear centrifuges and suspected weapons labs a few weeks ago. But the inconsistency also appears rooted in the splits inside Mr. Trump’s national security team as it grapples anew with one of the longest-lasting and most vexing problems in American foreign policy: How to stop Iran’s nuclear program without going to war over it. So far, the result is a blitz of mixed messages, conflicting signals and blustering threats, not unlike the way Mr. Trump and his aides talk about their ever-evolving tariff strategy. The issue came to the fore on Monday night when Mr. Witkoff began talking about his first encounter with Iran’s foreign minister last Saturday in Oman. The meeting went well, he said, plunging into the complex world of Iran’s nuclear program, which has taken it to the very threshold of building a weapon.

"Three students were wounded by gunfire and a fourth also was injured when gunfire erupted at Wilmer-Hutchins High School on Tuesday afternoon, officials said.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Three students were wounded by gunfire and a fourth also was injured when gunfire erupted at Wilmer-Hutchins High School on Tuesday afternoon, officials said. By Neil Vigdor Three students were wounded in a shooting on Tuesday at a Dallas high school where, almost exactly a year ago, a student was shot in the leg by a classmate, the authorities said. A fourth student suffered a “musculoskeletal injury” to his lower body during the shooting on Tuesday, said Jason Evans, a spokesman for Dallas Fire-Rescue, who said that all four victims were male. Three of the victims were between the ages of 15 and 18, while the fourth student’s age was not immediately known. The authorities said that they were searching for a suspect, whose identity was known to investigators. The injuries ranged in severity, some of them serious, according to emergency medical workers, who responded around 1:10 p.m. local time to Wilmer-Hutchins High School, about 10 miles southeast of downtown Dallas. The gunfire erupted inside the school, which is part of the Dallas Independent School District, sending it into a lockdown and drawing a large number of officers from several law enforcement agencies to the campus. “Today, as we all know, the unthinkable has happened,” Stephanie S. Elizalde, the school district’s superintendent, said during a news conference. “And quite frankly, this is just becoming way too familiar, and it should not be familiar.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"President Trump is trying to influence which colleges receive federal financial support, a practice that began around the time of World War II.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by President Trump is trying to influence which colleges receive federal financial support, a practice that began around the time of World War II. By Talya Minsberg The showdown between the Trump administration and institutions of higher learning intensified on Tuesday, when President Trump threatened Harvard University’s tax-exempt status after the school refused to accept his administration’s demands on hiring, admissions and curriculum. His threat, and the stakes involved, highlighted not only the billions of dollars in government funding that colleges receive every year but how that practice started and what all that money goes toward. Around the time of World War II, the U.S. government started funding universities for the purpose of aiding the war effort, funneling money toward medical research, innovation and financial aid for students. The relationship between the federal government and higher education soon became symbiotic. As the government counted on universities to produce educated and employable students, as well as breakthrough scientific research, universities came to rely on continued funding. In 1970, the government dispersed about $3.4 billion to higher education. Today, individual colleges depend on what could be billions of dollars, which mainly go toward financial aid and research. Harvard alone receives about $9 billion in federal funds, with $7 billion going to the university’s 11 affiliated hospitals in Boston and Cambridge, Mass. The remaining $2 billion goes to research grants directly for Harvard. The funding freezes have caused work stoppages, cut contracts, imperiled medical research and left students in limbo. Reductions can also affect hospitals that are affiliated with universities, like the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children’s Hospital, both of which are affiliated with Harvard.

Biden Jr.’s first extensive speech since he left office, he accused the Trump administration of “taking a hatchet” to the Social Security Administration. transcript Fewer than 100 days this new administration has made so much, done so much damage and so much destruction. It’s kind of breathtaking it could happen that soon. They’ve taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration, pushing additional 7,000 employees, 7,000 out the door in that time, including the most seasoned career officials. Now they’re getting ready to push thousands more out the door. 73 million Americans receive Social Security. From their first paycheck for their entire life they pay into Social Security, and in return they count on Social Security to be for them when they’re going to need it. Folks must never, ever betray that trust or turn our backs on that obligation. That’s why during my presidency we protected Social Security and made it stronger. By Julie BosmanShane GoldmacherKatie Glueck and Tyler Pager Julie Bosman reported from Chicago; Shane Goldmacher and Katie Glueck reported from New York; and Tyler Pager from Washington, D.C. Joseph R. Biden Jr. forcefully defended Social Security in a speech to disability advocates in Chicago on Tuesday, condemning the Trump administration for “taking a hatchet” to the Social Security Administration. In his first expansive public comments since leaving the White House, Mr. Biden said that President Trump had taken aim at Social Security, doing “damage and destruction” to a program that millions of Americans depend on. “Social Security deserves to be protected for the good of the nation as a whole,” Mr. Biden said, adding that Trump officials are applying a Silicon Valley mantra of “move fast and break things” to the government. “Well, they’re certainly breaking things. They’re shooting first and aiming later.” Mr. Trump has promised not to cut Social Security benefits for the 73 million Americans enrolled, but offices around the country have been flooded with calls and questions from Americans who are worried that changes to their benefits and to their local Social Security offices may be imminent. At local offices, many staff members have taken buyouts or early retirements promoted by the Trump administration’s cost-cutting efforts, leading to longer phone waits and lines. The Social Security Administration has said it wants to shed thousands of jobs at its headquarters. Mr. Biden said that during his own administration, the Social Security Administration cut wait times, improved antifraud measures and made the appeals system for benefits more uniform.

"David Hogg, a young liberal activist and now a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, is leading an effort to unseat the party’s older lawmakers in primaries.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by David Hogg, a young liberal activist and now a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, is leading an effort to unseat the party’s older lawmakers in primaries. By Shane Goldmacher Less than three months after the young political activist David Hogg was elected as a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, he is undertaking a new project that is sure to rankle some fellow Democrats: spending millions of dollars to oust Democratic members of Congress in primary elections next year. Mr. Hogg, 25, who emerged on the political scene as an outspoken survivor of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla., said his party must squelch a pervasive “culture of seniority politics” that has allowed older and less effective lawmakers to continue to hold office at a moment of crisis. And so he is planning through a separate organization where he serves as president, Leaders We Deserve, to intervene in primaries in solidly Democratic districts as part of a $20 million effort to elect younger leaders and to encourage a more combative posture against President Trump. In an interview, Mr. Hogg said he understood that he would face blowback for his decision to serve simultaneously as a top official in the party — which is typically focused on electing Democrats over Republicans — and as a leader of an effort to oust current Democratic lawmakers. “This is going to anger a lot of people,” Mr. Hogg said of his efforts, which he began to brief allies, some lawmakers and party officials on in recent days. He predicted “a smear campaign against me” that would aim to “destroy my reputation and try to force me to stop doing this.” “People say they want change in the Democratic Party, but really they want change so long as it doesn’t potentially endanger their position of power,” he said. “That’s not actually wanting change. That’s selfishness.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Harvard leaders believed saying no was worth the risk. By Alan BlinderAnemona HartocollisVimal Patel and Stephanie Saul Follow live updates on the Trump administration here. Late last week, officials at Harvard University were trying to decipher what the Trump administration wanted the school to do to combat antisemitism. The government had made some straightforward demands, like requiring the school to ban masks, which are often favored by protesters. But other demands seemed vague. Then, late on Friday night, the federal government sent Harvard a five-page fusillade of new demands that would reshape the school’s operations, admissions, hiring, faculty and student life. It took less than 72 hours for Harvard to say no. The decision is the most overt defiance by a university since President Trump began pressuring higher education to conform to his political priorities. It came after leaders at Harvard, during intense discussions over the weekend, determined that what the government was proposing represented a profound threat to the 388-year-old university’s independence and mission.

The police then used a stun gun on him twice. Back inside the room, Ms. Greene was unfazed as she greeted attendees at the event, in Acworth, Ga., northwest of Atlanta.

"Another service member was seriously wounded, the military said. The cause of the accident is under investigation.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Another service member was seriously wounded, the military said. The cause of the accident is under investigation. By Yan Zhuang and Eric Schmitt Two U.S. service members involved in operations near the border with Mexico were killed in a vehicle accident on Tuesday morning, and another was seriously injured, the military said. The cause of the accident near Santa Teresa, N.M., is under investigation, the military’s Northern Command said in a statement on social media. Santa Teresa is on the outskirts of El Paso, Tex. The military said the three had been deployed to support Joint Task Force Southern Border, which last month assumed leadership of military operations at that border as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to curtail illegal crossings. The military did not release the names of the service members who were killed. The three people were Marines, according to a U.S. military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters. The Marines were driving a civilian vehicle that rolled over in the accident, the official said. No other vehicles were involved, the official said. Thousands of troops have been sent to the southwestern border in recent months, following President Trump’s order to increase the military’s role in stemming the flow of migrants into the United States. Mr. Trump declared an emergency at the border on the first day of his second term and promised to send U.S. military forces to confront migrants, drug cartels and smugglers. About 1,600 Marines and Army soldiers were later sent to secure the border, joining 2,500 Army reservists already there. Another wave of troops was sent in February and March, bringing the total number of active-duty troops on the border to about 9,000, according to Defense Department officials. Vehicle accidents are a common cause of death in the U.S. military. From 2010 to 2019, at least 123 service members were killed as a result of 3,753 accidents involving tactical vehicles in noncombat situations, according to the Government Accountability Office, an independent watchdog agency for the federal government. Yan Zhuang is a Times reporter in Seoul who covers breaking news. Eric Schmitt is a national security correspondent for The Times, focusing on U.S. military affairs and counterterrorism issues overseas, topics he has reported on for more than three decades.

"An arcane Senate tradition effectively gives senators veto power over nominees for U.S. attorney in their home states, providing Democrats a potential opening to stop President Trump’s picks.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by An arcane Senate tradition effectively gives senators veto power over nominees for U.S. attorney in their home states, providing Democrats a potential opening to stop President Trump’s picks. By Carl Hulse Reporting from the Capitol Democrats have so far failed to derail any of President Trump’s nominees, lacking the numbers in the Senate to block them. But they are about to test their ability to use an arcane Senate tradition to stop Mr. Trump from installing one lesser-known but critical category of nominee: federal prosecutors. For decades, heads of the Senate Judiciary Committee of both parties have sought the approval of home-state senators before moving ahead with the nominations of U.S. attorneys, waiting to proceed until they receive what is known as a “blue slip” indicating the senators’ approval. Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat and minority leader, will be the first to challenge Mr. Trump on his selections, by refusing to return blue slips consenting to consider the nominees for two top posts in New York: Jay Clayton to be the U.S. attorney for the Southern District and Joseph Nocella Jr. to be the lead prosecutor in the Eastern District. “Donald Trump has made clear he has no fidelity to the law and intends to use the Justice Department, the U.S. attorney offices and law enforcement as weapons to go after his perceived enemies,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement to The New York Times confirming his intent to withhold the blue slips. “Such blatant and depraved political motivations are deeply corrosive to the rule of law and leaves me deeply skeptical of Donald Trump’s intentions for these important positions.” His position is likely to anger the White House. But in a recent interview, Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the Judiciary Committee, said that he intended to respect the blue slip tradition. Given Mr. Schumer’s stance, that means the two high-priority nominations of Mr. Trump are on track to die in the committee without receiving a vote. “The answer is yes,” Mr. Grassley said when asked whether he would honor the blue slip position of senators. “If they are from the state the nomination comes from.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The new U.C.L.A. survey found that many adults in Los Angeles County had lost jobs or incomes to the fires, or knew someone who had been personally affected by the disaster.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The new U.C.L.A. survey found that many adults in Los Angeles County had lost jobs or incomes to the fires, or knew someone who had been personally affected by the disaster. By Shawn Hubler A new survey released on Wednesday found that the Los Angeles wildfires took an extraordinary financial and emotional toll on millions of people in Southern California that extended far beyond the communities that burned. More than 40 percent of the adults surveyed said they knew someone who had been personally affected by the wildfires that began on Jan. 7. The polling equivalent of more than a million adults said the fires had directly cost them jobs or income. And about a third of respondents said they had donned masks to protect themselves from the smoke hazards. The survey, by the Luskin School of Public Affairs at the University of California, Los Angeles, underscored the extent to which the fires transcended the vastness of Southern California, where even large-scale disruptions can often be swallowed up by the region’s sheer size. Los Angeles County, the nation’s most populous at about 9.7 million residents, stretches for more than 4,000 square miles, encompassing 88 cities and about a quarter of the state’s population. The two main January fires — in Pacific Palisades on the Pacific Coast and in Altadena to the east, at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains — were more than 34 miles apart. But as hurricane-force winds whipped up one inferno after another, claiming 30 lives and destroying thousands of buildings, the threat of the disaster seemed to stretch countywide. The survey found that even in relatively unscathed places 20 miles or more from the fires, like the suburbs on the Palos Verdes Peninsula and in northern areas of the county, roughly a quarter of respondents said they knew someone who had lost a home or a business.

"State officials argue in a lawsuit that the U.S. Constitution expressly gives the authority to impose tariffs to Congress.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by State officials argue in a lawsuit that the U.S. Constitution expressly gives the authority to impose tariffs to Congress. By Shawn Hubler and Soumya Karlamangla California’s governor and attorney general sued President Trump on Wednesday to try to stop his flurry of tariffs, accusing the president of taking unlawful action to escalate a global trade war that has caused “immediate and irreparable harm” to the state’s economy. The lawsuit is the largest legal challenge yet to Mr. Trump’s trade policies. It was filed Wednesday in federal court in California by Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Attorney General Rob Bonta, both Democrats. Mr. Newsom said that California had a responsibility to fight the tariffs as the largest importer and second-largest exporter among the states, behind only oil-rich Texas. California’s economy would rank as the world’s fifth largest if the state were a nation and it represents 14 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. “Where the hell is Congress? Where the hell is Speaker Johnson? Do your job,” Mr. Newsom said Wednesday during a news conference at an almond farm in the Central Valley, the state’s agricultural center. He accused them of “sitting there passively” as Mr. Trump “wrecks the economy of the United States of America.” Mr. Trump’s tariffs are upending global trade. He imposed a 10 percent tariff on nearly all imports from most of the world, and his escalating tariffs with China have reached 145 percent. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, said he had not yet been allowed to see Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration and imprisoned.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, said he had not yet been allowed to see Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant who was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration and imprisoned. transcript If you listen to President Trump and the Trump administration, you would think that the U.S. courts have found that Mr. Abrego Garcia is part of MS-13, but in fact, they have not found that. I asked the [Salvadoran] vice president if Abrego Garcia has not committed a crime, and the U.S. courts have found that he was illegally taken from the United States, and the government of El Salvador has no evidence that he was part of MS-13, why is El Salvador continuing to hold him in CECOT? And his answer was that the Trump administration is paying El Salvador, the government of El Salvador, to keep him at CECOT. By Robert Jimison Reporting from San Salvador Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, on Wednesday tried and failed to secure a meeting in El Salvador with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant and Maryland resident who was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration and remains imprisoned in his native country. Mr. Van Hollen’s trip was the latest chapter in an intensifying political battle over the case of Mr. Abrego Garcia, who was removed from the United States last month in what immigration officials acknowledged was an error. Although the Supreme Court has instructed the U.S. government to facilitate his return, both American and Salvadoran authorities have so far refused to do so. Mr. Van Hollen met with El Salvador’s vice president, Félix Ulloa, as well as officials at the U.S. embassy there, but he came away with no assurances that he would be able to see or even speak to Mr. Abrego Garcia, who is being held in a notorious maximum security prison known for human rights violations. And his visit did little to change the minds of the Trump administration or Salvadoran officials who have refused to release Mr. Abrego Garcia. After his meeting with Mr. Ulloa, Mr. Van Hollen told reporters that the explanation the vice president provided for continuing to keep Mr. Abrego Garcia in detention in the absence of a criminal charge against him was that the Trump administration was paying El Salvador to do so. “I’m asking President Bukele under his authority as president of El Salvador to do the right thing and allow Mr. Abrego Garcia to walk out of a prison — a man who’s charged with no crime, convicted of no crime and who was illegally abducted from the United States,” Mr. Van Hollen told reporters in San Salvador, the capital. The Trump administration has accused Mr. Abrego Garcia of being a member of the dangerous transnational gang MS-13. Mr. Van Hollen portrayed him instead as an innocent family man who was illegally “abducted” from the streets of Maryland in a miscarriage of justice, and bluntly accused the Trump administration of “lying” to justify its mistakes in deporting him.

To the White House, that could mean negotiating trade deals — or even defending the president and his allies. By Michael S. SchmidtMaggie HabermanMatthew GoldsteinJessica Silver-GreenbergBen Protess and William K. Rashbaum When some of the nation’s biggest law firms agreed to deals with President Trump, the terms appeared straightforward: In return for escaping the full force of his retribution campaign, the firms would do some free legal work on behalf of largely uncontroversial causes like helping veterans. Mr. Trump, it turns out, has a far more expansive view of what those firms can be called on to do. Over the last week, he has suggested that the firms will be drafted into helping him negotiate trade deals. He has mused about having them help with his goal of reviving the coal industry. And he has hinted that he sees the promises of nearly $1 billion in pro bono legal services that he has extracted from the elite law firms — including Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; and Willkie Farr & Gallagher — as a legal war chest to be used as he wishes. “Have you noticed that lots of law firms have been signing up with Trump: $100 million, another $100 million for damages that they’ve done,” Mr. Trump said at an event last week with coal miners, without specifying what he meant by damages. None of the firms have acknowledged any wrongdoing. They were targeted with punitive executive orders or implicit threats for representing or aiding Mr. Trump’s political foes or employing people he sees as having used the legal system to come after him. The deals have been widely criticized, as they are seen by many in the legal community as unconstitutional and undemocratic. Four firms whom Mr. Trump leveled executive orders against have fought them in court, all quickly receiving rulings from federal judges who temporarily halted them.

"The World Trade Organization warned that tariffs would push down both U.S. exports and imports and that trade wars could put poorer countries at risk.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Global Economy Advertisement Supported by The World Trade Organization warned that tariffs would push down both U.S. exports and imports and that trade wars could put poorer countries at risk. By Ana Swanson Reporting from Washington The World Trade Organization forecast on Wednesday that President Trump’s trade policies would shave nearly three percentage points off the volume of global trade in goods this year, as tariffs raise the price of U.S. imports, invite retaliation and slow economic activity. At the start of the year, the W.T.O. expected goods trading to continue growing roughly in line with the global economy, expanding by 2.7 percent. Now it expects it to contract by 0.2 percent instead. That’s a sharp drop from last year, when goods trade grew by 2.9 percent. Mr. Trump has introduced a suite of tariffs, including a 10 percent tariff on most of the world, a minimum tariff of 145 percent on U.S. imports from China, levies on goods from Canada and Mexico and sector-specific tariffs targeting steel, aluminum and vehicles. The Trump administration says this will help bring manufacturing back to the United States and boost the economy, though many economists have predicted the tariffs will instead be a drag on economic activity. The W.T.O., a Geneva-based group that monitors patterns in global trade and coordinates trade negotiations and disputes among its members, said that the estimates were based on the tariff situation as of Monday, and that trade could shrink further “if the situation deteriorates.” The tariffs will have the biggest impact on trade in North America, the group said, where it expects exports will plummet 12.6 percent and imports will drop 9.6 percent in 2025. Asia will be the next most affected, but Asia and Europe will still post modest growth in both exports and imports, the group forecasts. The group said global trade was particularly at risk from the potential return of Mr. Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs.” The president paused those tariffs last week for 90 days, and the Trump administration is now trying to negotiate trade deals with individual countries.

"The suspect charged in the attack on the Pennsylvania governor’s residence said he was seeking to “stop having my friends killed,” according to a police search warrant.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Middle East Tensions Advertisement Supported by The suspect charged in the attack on the Pennsylvania governor’s residence said he was seeking to “stop having my friends killed,” according to a police search warrant. By Billy Witz Reporting from Pittsburgh The man charged with setting fire to the Pennsylvania governor’s mansion staged the attack because he believed Gov. Josh Shapiro’s stance on the war in Gaza was leading to the deaths of Palestinians, according to a police search warrant made public on Wednesday. After the attack on the governor’s residence in Harrisburg, Pa., the suspect, Cody A. Balmer, identified himself on a 911 call and said that Mr. Shapiro, who is Jewish, “needs to know that he ‘will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people,’” according to the search warrant. “Balmer continues saying he needs to stop having my friends killed, and ‘our people have been put through too much by that monster,’” an apparent reference to Mr. Shapiro, though it was not spelled out in the warrant. Mr. Balmer, who had been treated for mental illness and was facing a separate charge of having assaulted his family in an earlier case, said at the end of the call: “You know where to find me. I’m not hiding and I will confess to everything that I’ve done.” In an interview with the police after he turned himself in, Mr. Balmer “admitted to harboring hatred” of Mr. Shapiro and said that he would have “beaten him with his hammer” had he run into him on the night of the attack at the mansion, according to an affidavit filed in the case. With the search warrant, the Pennsylvania State Police seized four smartphones, a laptop and an external hard drive. Investigators are combing through Mr. Balmer’s writing and notes “that contain any of the following: the name of Josh Shapiro; reference to Palestine, Gaza, Israel or the current conflict in Gaza,” the warrant said.

"The project represents something of a shift in mission for Elon Musk’s initiative, from cutting government costs toward a new goal of generating revenue.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The project represents something of a shift in mission for Elon Musk’s initiative, from cutting government costs toward a new goal of generating revenue. By Ryan Mac and Hamed Aleaziz Ryan Mac reported from Los Angeles, and Hamed Aleaziz from Washington. Members of Elon Musk’s government-slashing task force are building a system for the United States to sell special immigration visas, which President Trump has labeled “gold cards,” for $5 million apiece. Engineers associated with Mr. Musk’s team have been working with employees from the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to create a website and application process for the visas, according to three people familiar with the discussions and documents seen by The New York Times. The project represents something of a shift in mission for Mr. Musk’s team, the Department of Government Efficiency, from its initial task of cutting government costs toward a new goal of generating revenue. In late February, Mr. Trump announced his idea for a gold card to give “very high-level people” a “route to citizenship.” The president and his commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, provided few details at the time about who would qualify for the program but noted that it would replace the EB-5 visa, which grants permanent residence to foreign nationals willing to invest in U.S. businesses. That program provided green cards to individuals who invested either $800,000 or $1.05 million, creating at least 10 jobs for American workers. It raised about $4 billion for the U.S. economy last year. The gold card project is being led from the DOGE side by Marko Elez and Edward Coristine, who have been working on it since at least last month. Mr. Elez and Mr. Coristine have met with officials at various agencies that oversee facets of the visa and immigrant vetting process to understand which existing processes can be incorporated into their new system.

"The lawsuit came just days after the administration threatened to cut off funding to the state’s public schools and lunch programs through grants from the Education and Agriculture Departments.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The lawsuit came just days after the administration threatened to cut off funding to the state’s public schools and lunch programs through grants from the Education and Agriculture Departments. transcript Today, the Department of Justice is announcing a civil lawsuit against the Maine Department of Education. The State of Maine is discriminating against women by failing to protect women in women’s sports. Pretty basic stuff. I don’t care if it’s one. I don’t care if it’s two, I don’t care if it’s 100. It’s going to stop and it’s going to stop in every single state. By Glenn Thrush Reporting from Washington The Trump administration sued Maine on Wednesday over policies that allow some transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports, claiming the state is violating a federal law intended to prevent discrimination based on sex. Attorney General Pam Bondi, announcing the move at a news conference while flanked by young female athletes from the state, acknowledged that Maine’s policies permitted very few transgender students to compete — perhaps only two, according to state officials. “I don’t care if it’s one, I don’t care if it’s two, I don’t care if it’s 100 — it’s going to stop, and it’s going to stop in every single state,” said Ms. Bondi, who suggested that the Justice Department was considering similar action against Minnesota and California for failing to comply with demands by President Trump that the states immediately reverse course. The lawsuit came just days after the administration threatened to cut off funding to Maine’s public schools and lunch programs through grants from the Education and Agriculture Departments. A federal judge temporarily blocked the move from going into effect. The Justice Department has also pulled $1.5 million in grants from Maine’s Corrections Department for housing a transgender woman in a women’s prison, according to a fact sheet distributed by officials. The lawsuit was not unexpected. Maine’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, has said she expected the department to take such action, defiantly telling Mr. Trump, “See you in court,” after he began ramping up attacks on her.

"Secretary of State Marco Rubio put about 40 employees on leave who had tracked disinformation by China, Russia, Iran and terrorist groups.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Secretary of State Marco Rubio put about 40 employees on leave who had tracked disinformation by China, Russia, Iran and terrorist groups. By Edward Wong Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his aides shut down a State Department office on Wednesday that tracks and counters global disinformation from foreign actors, including the governments of China, Russia and Iran, U.S. officials said. The closing of the office, the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Hub, had been in the works for weeks. Mr. Rubio put all 40 or so of its employees on paid leave on Wednesday morning, the first step in firing them this spring. The State Department fired about 80 contractors working for the office in March and cut almost all contracts related to its work. The office had been tracking disinformation campaigns by rival powers of the United States, as well as terrorist groups, and publishing reports on them. Some Republican lawmakers in recent years have accused federal employees and nongovernment experts working on tracking disinformation of trying to stifle the views of right-wing political groups around the world and trying to coordinate with social media companies to do so. Russian disinformation often circulates in far-right online channels. Mr. Rubio released a statement before noon on Wednesday announcing the closure, saying that the office and its precursor in the Biden administration had “spent millions of dollars to actively silence and censor the voices of Americans they were supposed to be serving.” Mr. Rubio did not present any evidence to support the claim. James P. Rubin, a former State Department official who ran the precursor to the office in the Biden administration, pushed back on the move to shutter the operation. “This amounts to a form of unilateral disarmament in the information warfare Russia and China are conducting all over the world,” he said on Wednesday.

"The move was a remarkable attempt by a jurist to hold the White House accountable for its apparent willingness to flout court orders.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The move was a remarkable attempt by a jurist to hold the White House accountable for its apparent willingness to flout court orders. By Alan Feuer A federal judge in Washington threatened on Wednesday to open a high-stakes contempt investigation into whether the Trump administration had violated an order he issued last month directing officials to stop planes of Venezuelan migrants from being sent to El Salvador. In a 46-page ruling, the judge, James E. Boasberg, said he would begin contempt proceedings against the administration unless the White House did what it had failed to do for more than a month: give scores of Venezuelan men deported to El Salvador under the expansive authority of a wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act a chance to challenge their removal. “The court does not reach such conclusions lightly or hastily,” wrote Judge Boasberg, who sits as the chief judge in Federal District Court in Washington. “Indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.” Judge Boasberg’s threat of contempt proceedings, coupled with another federal judge’s move on Tuesday to open a similar inquiry in a separate deportation case, represented a remarkable attempt by jurists to hold the White House accountable for its apparent willingness to flout court orders. The twin decisions also showed that judges remain willing to push back against the administration’s broader inclination to probe the traditional, but increasingly fragile, balance of power between the executive and judicial branches. Should administration officials slow-walk his efforts, Judge Boasberg warned that he could make a criminal referral to the Justice Department or even appoint an outside prosecutor. Judge Boasberg’s move came one day after Judge Paula Xinis said at a hearing in Federal District Court in Maryland that she would begin her own accelerated investigation into whether the White House had violated a ruling by the Supreme Court.

"The Michigan man emailed to say “someone might have a bomb” when his girlfriend went on a Caribbean cruise with her family, leaving him to care for their pets, according to court filings.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The Michigan man emailed to say “someone might have a bomb” when his girlfriend went on a Caribbean cruise with her family, leaving him to care for their pets, according to court filings. By Johnny Diaz A Michigan man who was upset that he was left to watch the pets when his girlfriend went on a cruise to the Caribbean with her family was sentenced Monday to eight months in prison for making a false bomb threat, federal prosecutors said. An investigation began after the man, Joshua Darrell Lowe, who was 19 at the time of his arrest, of Bailey, Mich., sent an email to Carnival Cruise Line in January 2024, that read, “Hey, I think someone might have a bomb on your Sunrise cruise ship,” according to court records. The threat caused the vessel, which had departed from Miami, to be escorted by Jamaican maritime authorities and diverted to a port in their country. Mr. Lowe was sentenced during an appearance in federal court in Kalamazoo, according to filings in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. He had been indicted in September on one charge of making a bomb threat, prosecutors said. “Although the defendant may not have intended all the harm that resulted from his action, the consequences of his email were serious,” Nils R. Kessler, an assistant attorney with the Western District, wrote in the legal complaint filed in court. “The hoax resulted in substantial disruption, including inconvenience to the passengers and potential lost revenue to the cruise line.” The ship was fully booked and staffed when the authorities had to conduct a search, which included checking more than 1,100 cabins, prosecutors said. The guest capacity for the Sunrise is 2,984, according to the Carnival Cruise Line’s website. “The ship was escorted into its next port of call by the Jamaican Marine Police,” Mr. Kessler wrote in court filings. Carnival Cruise investigators and F.B.I. agents traced the email address to Mr. Lowe, who was living with his girlfriend’s family, prosecutors said.

Maloney of the Western District. “This is all my fault and take full responsibility, it should never have happened,” he wrote. Mr. Lowe pleaded guilty to one count of false information and hoaxes, which could have carried a penalty of up to five years in prison, prosecutors said. Following his eight-month prison sentence, he will be under supervised release for two years, according to court records.

"Bernie Sanders and his apparent heir, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have drawn enormous crowds on their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, energizing a beaten-down Democratic Party.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Bernie Sanders and his apparent heir, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, have drawn enormous crowds on their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, energizing a beaten-down Democratic Party. By Kellen Browning Reporting from Folsom, Calif. The biggest political rallies anywhere in America right now are being headlined by an 83-year-old senator in the twilight of his career and his 35-year-old protégée. Roughly 36,000 people in Los Angeles. More than 34,000 attendees in Denver. And another 30,000 on Tuesday night near Sacramento. Those monster crowds — more than 200,000 people in all, according to organizers — have turned out to cheer on a fiery anti-Trump, anti-billionaire message from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York during their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour of Western states. Mr. Sanders even surprised attendees at the Coachella music festival near Los Angeles last week, popping onstage to introduce the singer Clairo and make an appeal to young people. As Democrats search for a spark after being routed in November, the two progressives are providing the kindling, offering the party’s beaten-down base the fighting spirit it has been missing ever since President Trump returned to office. Even as some top Democrats tack to the center or try to find common ground with the emboldened Republican president, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez dismiss the notion of any concessions. Instead, they have stuck to the simple argument that won over millions during Mr. Sanders’s two runs for president and endeared him to the types of working-class voters who abandoned Democrats in November: The system is broken, with the wealthy enriching themselves while others scrape by. “All over this country, people are struggling, every single day, just to survive,” Mr. Sanders told the crowd on Tuesday in Folsom, Calif. “Brothers and sisters, in the richest country in the history of the world, we can do a hell of a lot better than that!” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Then came the recount that threatened to unravel their achievement. By Hank Sanders Hank competed in Constitution Team at Lincoln High School in Portland, Ore., in 2016-17. He did not do well. Matthew Meyers and Colin Williams became best friends over a semantic argument about the word “homicide” in a freshman history class. Three years later, the wiry-thin, floppy-haired seniors at Sprague High School in Salem, Ore., remained inseparable when they competed as a pair in Constitution Team, a debate-style contest where teams answer questions about constitutional law. In January, they won second place at the state-level competition, earning themselves a spot at the national finals. Occasionally, an undersize team of nine to 15 students reaches nationals, where the average team size is 21 students. But a team of two had never made it, much less won, according to the Center for Civic Education, which organizes the event, formally known as “We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution National Finals.” It would be like a baseball team winning a game with four players. And yet, for four magical days, Mr. Williams and Mr. Meyers basked in the glow of that improbable achievement.

"It was not immediately clear why every generating plant on the island went offline Wednesday. Puerto Rico has a history of problems with its electricity supply.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by It was not immediately clear why every generating plant on the island went offline Wednesday. Puerto Rico has a history of problems with its electricity supply. By Patricia Mazzei Reporting from Miami More than 1.4 million customers in Puerto Rico lost electricity on Wednesday when all of the island’s power plants were knocked out of service, the latest frustrating blackout for residents who have suffered years of them. A preliminary review suggested the cause was a problem near a transmission line that began at 12:38 p.m., according to Josué Colón, the island’s energy czar. He said the work to restore the power would most likely extend well into Thursday. “This process is not going to end today,” he said in a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. By late Wednesday, some power plants were slowly starting to turn back on, and 7 percent of customers had electricity restored, officials said. The blackout led to gridlock on Puerto Rico’s roads as transit officers tried to direct cars at intersections with disabled traffic lights. People rushed to gas stations for fuel to power emergency generators. An urban train in San Juan, the capital, came to a stop, forcing passengers to clamber out and walk down an overpass. Plaza Las Américas, the island’s biggest mall, largely shut down. Puerto Rico has suffered extensive power grid problems since Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017, including periodic blackouts that have exasperated residents and businesses, forcing them to change or cancel plans and lose appliances and electronics to unpredictable power surges. The island often recovers slowly from major power disruptions. It has taken as long as several days to restore service after similar blackouts in the past, including an archipelago-wide outage on New Year’s Eve. That blackout, like the one on Wednesday, included the smaller island municipalities of Vieques and Culebra. Hundreds of thousands of customers had also lost potable water service because of the outage. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

She bested many of her opponents. By Eve Sampson A female Army Ranger competed for the first time in one of the military’s most grueling tests of physical fitness, besting many of her male counterparts and challenging assertions by the U.S. secretary of defense regarding women’s abilities to perform at the highest levels. First Lt. Gabrielle White and her teammate, Capt. Seth Deltenre, placed 14th out of 52 teams during the weekend’s Best Ranger Competition, a three-day event in Georgia at which some of the Army’s most elite soldiers compete in land navigation, marksmanship and an array of physically strenuous tasks. Lieutenant White was the first woman to participate in the four decades that the event has been held. Her team’s achievement — she and Captain Deltenre finished among the top competitors after 36 other pairs were eliminated — came less than a decade after women were first granted access to the Army’s Ranger School, a rigorous monthslong course with a high rate of failure. Some saw Lieutenant White’s performance at the competition as a rejoinder, however unintended, to comments by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth questioning the abilities of women in the military. “I saw a three-day public display of what we’ve been saying for 10 years,” said Kris Fuhr, a West Point graduate who was instrumental in integrating women into the Ranger School at Fort Benning in 2015. Mr. Hegseth, a former National Guard infantryman and Fox News host, has spoken critically of the inclusion of women in combat roles. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"A directive from the Justice Department, which says the move is intended to reduce a backlog in immigration court, would result in rapid deportation orders in many cases.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by A directive from the Justice Department, which says the move is intended to reduce a backlog in immigration court, would result in rapid deportation orders in many cases. By Miriam Jordan Reporting from Washington A new Trump administration policy urges immigration judges to swiftly deny asylum to migrants whose applications they deem unlikely to succeed. The expedited dismissals would circumvent the normal hearing process, which typically takes years to wind through the backlogged courts. The guidance from the Justice Department, which took effect April 11, states that judges should consider dropping “legally deficient” asylum cases without holding a hearing. Doing that would keep some people who claim to be fleeing persecution in their home countries from having any opportunity to present their case to a judge. “Adjudicators have the duty to efficiently manage their dockets,” Sirce Owen, acting director of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees the immigration courts, wrote in the policy memo. “It is clear from the almost four million pending cases on E.O.I.R.’s docket that has not been happening.” The memo, sent to staff members, says that immigration judges should take “all appropriate action to immediately resolve cases on their dockets that do not have viable legal paths for relief or protection from removal.” The new policy would inevitably result in judges issuing deportation orders before fully holding what are known as merits hearings, in which asylum applicants can present their claims in detail. Immigration judges have the authority to decide whether an immigrant can remain in the United States or should be removed. The judges are employees of the Justice Department, not the federal courts, so they are expected to follow policies set by the agency. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Ed Martin, the Republican activist serving as interim U.S. attorney in Washington, has hired a longtime Trump ally who boasts about his combative style to be an adviser, including on the Senate confirmation process. Michael R. Caputo, who served as a spokesman for the first Trump administration’s Covid response until taking medical leave after accusing federal scientists of “sedition,” officially joined Mr. Martin’s office last week. Mr. Caputo has been informally counseling Mr. Martin as the prosecutor has pursued widely criticized inquiries into congressional Democrats, pardoned Biden family members and Justice Department officials who investigated President Trump’s ties to Russia. Mr. Martin has defended those initiatives as part of an effort to restore accountability to a justice system that Mr. Trump and his allies say has unfairly targeted them, while going easy on violent criminals. Mr. Martin cast the hiring of Mr. Caputo as more closely aligning his office’s mission with Mr. Trump’s. “Because Michael has known President Trump for over 40 years, he’s uniquely positioned to help us make America great again,” Mr. Martin said in a statement. He called Mr. Caputo “a great fighter” and highlighted his deep connections in Republican politics. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The health secretary said he would prioritize studies into environmental causes while harshly discounting other factors scientists say are likely contributing to rising rates of the condition.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The health secretary said he would prioritize studies into environmental causes while harshly discounting other factors scientists say are likely contributing to rising rates of the condition. By Karoun DemirjianDani Blum and Azeen Ghorayshi In remarks laced with scientific inaccuracies, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said on Wednesday that autism was preventable while directly contradicting researchers within his own agency on a primary driver behind rising rates of the condition in young children. Mr. Kennedy made his comments at a news conference, responding to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that rates of autism had increased to one in 31 among 8-year-olds, continuing a long-running trend. Blaming environmental risk factors for the uptick, he accused the media and the public of succumbing to a “myth of epidemic denial” when it came to autism. He also called research into the genetic factors that scientists say play a vital role in whether a child will develop autism “a dead end.” “Genes don’t cause epidemics,” he said. “You need an environmental toxin.” Autism rates among children have increased nearly fivefold since 2000, when the C.D.C. first began collecting data on the condition’s incidence in children. The C.D.C.’s new report attributed some of the increase in autism’s prevalence to more screening for the condition. And researchers have pointed to several other factors, including greater awareness of what autism looks like, more access to services, more parents having children later in life and broader definitions of the disorder. Mr. Kennedy vowed that under his leadership, the health department would focus on looking into certain substances, like mold and food additives, and parental obesity to try to reverse rising rates of autism in children. “These are kids who, many of them, were fully functional and regressed because of some environmental exposure into autism when they’re 2 years old,” he said.

"The wire service on Wednesday accused The White House of continuing to bar its reporters from the press pool despite a judge’s order that called the restriction a violation of the First Amendment.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The wire service on Wednesday accused The White House of continuing to bar its reporters from the press pool despite a judge’s order that called the restriction a violation of the First Amendment. By Tim Balk The Associated Press said in a court filing on Wednesday that the Trump administration had defied a federal judge’s order requiring the administration to restore the wire service’s full access to the White House. Lawyers for the The A.P. wrote that a White House spokesman had told A.P. reporters on Monday that they would continue to be excluded from the press pool — a small, rotating group of journalists who cover certain events in confined spaces at the White House — because the “case is ‘ongoing.’” For the last two months, The A.P.’s access to President Trump has been sharply curtailed over its refusal to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, the name that Mr. Trump designated for the body of water. In a temporary order last week, Judge Trevor N. McFadden of the Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., said the exclusion violated the First Amendment’s free-speech clause and instructed the White House to restore The A.P.’s access “immediately.” Still, on Wednesday, the White House continued to exclude The A.P. from the press pool, the filing said. It requested the judge’s “immediate assistance in enforcing” last week’s order, citing the White House’s “refusal to obey” the court’s decision. Judge McFadden responded to The A.P.’s filing on Wednesday by scheduling a hearing in his court for Friday morning. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer for the Justice Department, Jane M. Lyons, wrote in an email to The A.P.’s legal team on Monday that the outlet had not been allowed into the pool that day “because it was not its turn,” according to court papers.

"The three, an 11-year-old girl and two 18-year-olds, went into the water after fishing on Tuesday evening, fire officials in Nebraska said.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The three, an 11-year-old girl and two 18-year-olds, went into the water after fishing on Tuesday evening, fire officials in Nebraska said. By Aimee Ortiz Rescue workers in Nebraska searched the Missouri River on Wednesday for three people believed to have drowned after going into the water on Tuesday evening, fire officials said. One of the three is an 11-year-old girl and the other two are 18-year-old women, said Coby Werner, the fire battalion chief for the Omaha Fire Department. Two pairs of shoes that matched witnesses’ description of what they were wearing were found in the river on Tuesday night, he said. Rescue crews from several agencies, including the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office, battled windy conditions during their search on Wednesday, Chief Werner said. The search for the girls began after a bystander found a 13-year-old girl on the riverbank in N.P. Dodge Park just before 6 p.m. on Tuesday. The girl, who was described as “hysterical,” told the bystander that she had gone into the water with the three others from a spot where they had been fishing, Chief Werner said. The current “kind of carried them downstream a little bit,” he said, and the three missing people went under water and did not resurface. The chief said the girls were related, but it was unclear how. The Missouri River has a “pretty good current,” Chief Werner said, calling it a “dangerous body of the water.” Its depth in that area is as deep as 15 feet, he said, with a temperature of 45 degrees — enough to make someone “hypothermic within a matter of minutes.” Chief Werner said rescue workers had broken the river into different quadrants and sections, with “over eight boats from multiple different agencies out here all day.” He described the river there as murky and muddy, with rocks, logs and other debris that can occasionally flow through. According to the local television station KMTV, “Flooding is a familiar struggle at N.P. Dodge Park.” It’s early in the year for water rescues, according to Chief Werner. He said these typically “start a little bit more once you get to the latter half of May and then throughout the summer.” Chief Werner said that when it comes to a drowning or a water rescue, the first hour that someone is in the water is the “golden hour.” “After that we slowly kind of transition into a recovery mode.” he said. As of Wednesday morning, he added, rescue crews were in “recovery mode.” That “doesn’t mean we’re not still doing everything we can to search,” Chief Werner said, but it “means we’re slowing down a little bit and doing more of a methodical search.” Aimee Ortiz covers breaking news and other topics.

By Jesus Jiménez Reporting from Los Angeles When federal agents arrived at two Los Angeles elementary schools last week to conduct welfare checks on students who the agents said were undocumented, fear and outrage spread among parents, teachers and administrators. For the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, the visit by federal agents was something more. It was personal. Alberto Carvalho, the leader of the second-largest public school system in the country, was once undocumented, too. “Their journey is no different than my own,” Mr. Carvalho said in an interview, referring to the estimated one in four migrant students who are believed to be undocumented in his district. “Maybe the country of origin is different, but in many, many instances, the journey is exactly the same.” At a news conference after the visit, he condemned the agents’ actions. His speech drew national attention on social media, and his acknowledgment of his own former status as undocumented represented a rare moment in an era of immigration crackdowns. Mr. Carvalho told those gathered outside the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce that if it sounded like he was coming across with “a certain degree of contempt and anger,” that was because he was.

"A new “gold card” visa reveals how Elon Musk’s group has seemingly expanded its functional power.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Newsletter A new “gold card” visa reveals how Elon Musk’s group has seemingly expanded its functional power. By Jess Bidgood When President Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency, its mandate was to modernize “federal technology and software.” It has done a lot more than that. But today, my colleagues Ryan Mac and Hamed Aleaziz reported that Elon Musk’s outfit is doing something entirely new: building a system to sell $5 million “special immigration visas.” Musk, whose exact government job description remains unclear, has been working on building the software, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on a recent podcast. Musk and his team are trying to speed up the typical vetting process for immigrants so that rich applicants can obtain U.S. residency in a matter of weeks. They have been working with employees from the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to create the website and application process. It’s a story that reveals how DOGE’s functional power has seemingly expanded, with the group going so far as to rework a corner of the nation’s immigration system. Ryan and Hamed noted that it also shows how the Musk outfit is not only trying to cut jobs and contracts but also generate revenue. And it’s an example of how its staff members are building structures and systems that might outlast them. Many of DOGE’s employees — and Musk — are “special government employees,” who are allowed to perform “important, but limited” services to the government for 130 days a year.

"The New York City medical examiner’s office determined the cause and manner of her death after reviewing toxicology test results, a spokeswoman said.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Michelle Trachtenberg (1985-2025) Advertisement Supported by The New York City medical examiner’s office determined the cause and manner of her death after reviewing toxicology test results, a spokeswoman said. By Alexandra E. Petri Michelle Trachtenberg, the “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Gossip Girl” actress who was found dead in a Manhattan apartment in February, died from complications of diabetes, the New York City medical examiner’s office said on Wednesday. The medical examiner’s office initially said that the cause and manner of Ms. Trachtenberg’s death was “undetermined.” The office amended that conclusion this week after reviewing toxicology test results, a spokeswoman Julie Bolcer, said on Wednesday, ruling that she died a natural death from complications of diabetes mellitus. Officers with the New York Police Department found Ms. Trachtenberg, 39, unconscious and unresponsive in the apartment after responding to a 911 call just after 8 a.m. on Feb. 26. She was pronounced dead by emergency medical workers, who had also responded, the authorities said at the time. No autopsy was performed because of religious objections from Ms. Trachtenberg’s family, Ms. Bolcer said. Ms. Trachtenberg began acting in commercials at age 3. Before she was 10, she was making regular appearances in television shows, including the Nickelodeon sitcom “The Adventures of Pete & Pete” and the ABC daytime drama “All My Children.” At 11, Ms. Trachtenberg landed the title role in the film “Harriet the Spy” (1996). She drew praise for her performance as Harriet Welsch, the precocious girl who draws scorn from schoolmates over her imagined spy adventures, which she meticulously chronicles in a notebook. She found a new level of fame as a troubled teenager on the supernatural 1990s series “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and as a conniving young socialite on “Gossip Girl.” Advertisement","michelle trachtenberg new york city medical examiner office determined cause manner death reviewing toxicology test results spokeswoman said alexandra e petri michelle trachtenberg buffy vampire slayer gossip girl actress found dead manhattan apartment february died complications diabetes new york city medical examiner office said wednesday medical examiner office initially said cause manner ms trachtenberg death undetermined office amended conclusion week reviewing toxicology test results spokeswoman julie bolcer said wednesday ruling died natural death complications diabetes mellitus officers new york police department found ms trachtenberg unconscious unresponsive apartment responding call just am feb pronounced dead emergency medical workers also responded authorities said time autopsy performed religious objections ms trachtenberg family ms bolcer said ms trachtenberg began acting commercials age making regular appearances television shows including nickelodeon sitcom adventures pete pete abc daytime drama children ms trachtenberg landed title role film harriet spy drew praise performance harriet welsch precocious girl draws scorn schoolmates imagined spy adventures meticulously chronicles notebook found new level fame troubled teenager supernatural s series buffy vampire slayer conniving young socialite gossip girl"
"The administration appears to be using little more than body art to deport people that it says are members of Tren de Aragua, a move that critics say ignores decades of protocol.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The administration appears to be using little more than body art to deport people that it says are members of Tren de Aragua, a move that critics say ignores decades of protocol. By Tim ArangoChelsia Rose Marcius and Jesus Jiménez Tim Arango and Jesus Jiménez reported from Los Angeles, and Chelsia Rose Marcius from New York. In the early days of the first Trump administration, immigration agents arrested Daniel Ramirez Medina at his family’s apartment in a suburb of Seattle and accused him of being a gang member. Their evidence was a tattoo on his left forearm of a five-point star that read, “La Paz — BCS.” Born in Mexico and raised in California, Mr. Ramirez had been able to work and raise his son without fear of deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Even so, he spent six weeks in a detention center, as the government tried to deport him. A judge eventually ruled that the tattoo was a reference to his birthplace and ordered him released. This time around, the second Trump administration appears to be relying more heavily on tattoos to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants that it says are members of the gang Tren de Aragua, in a move that some critics argue ignores decades of police and legal protocol. Tattoos are often just a starting point in an investigation, many law enforcement officials say. And Tren de Aragua is still relatively new in the United States, so any indicators of affiliation might be less reliable than what officials have been able to gather over the years about more longstanding street gangs. In February of last year, the New York Police Department began to receive reports from federal authorities about members of Tren de Aragua traveling from Denver and Colorado toward the East Coast. The Police Department had little information on the Venezuelan gang, which was new in the country and in New York City. But one indicator, the police learned, were the tattoos that members bore to show their allegiance. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Five students were wounded in the shooting at Wilmer-Hutchins High School in Dallas, the second one there in just over a year, the authorities said.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Five students were wounded in the shooting at Wilmer-Hutchins High School in Dallas, the second one there in just over a year, the authorities said. By Neil Vigdor A 17-year-old who opened fire at a Dallas high school on Tuesday, wounding five students, was able to bypass metal detectors by entering through an unsecured door that another student had opened for him, the authorities said. The gunman, Tracy Denard Haynes Jr., was charged with aggravated assault as part of a mass shooting, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. He turned himself in to the authorities on Tuesday night. The shooting at Wilmer-Hutchins High School, about 10 miles southeast of downtown Dallas, was the second episode of gun violence to occur there in almost exactly one year. Last April, a student was charged with shooting one of his classmates in the leg while they were in class. Around 1 p.m. on Tuesday, investigators said, Mr. Haynes began shooting indiscriminately at a group of male students in a hallway after getting inside the school. The gunfire sent people running for cover, but one student was not able to get away, a school police officer said in the affidavit, citing security camera footage. That was when Mr. Haynes “appeared to take a point-blank shot,” the officer said. Investigators said that five students were struck by the gunfire, which led the authorities to place the high school and a nearby elementary school on lockdown. Classes were canceled for the rest of the week at the high school. A motive for the shooting was not immediately clear. Four of the students who were injured in the shooting were taken to hospitals, said Jason L. Evans, a spokesman for Dallas Fire-Rescue. As of Wednesday, two of them had been released, and the other two were being kept for observation, he said. It was unclear whether the fifth student who investigators had said had been struck by gunfire had received medical treatment. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Israel developed plans for attacking Iranian nuclear facilities that would have required U.S. assistance. But some administration officials had doubts.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Middle East Tensions Advertisement Supported by Israel developed plans for attacking Iranian nuclear facilities that would have required U.S. assistance. But some administration officials had doubts. By Julian E. BarnesEric SchmittMaggie Haberman and Ronen Bergman Julian E. Barnes, Eric Schmitt and Maggie Haberman reported from Washington. Ronen Bergman reported from Tel Aviv. Israel had planned to strike Iranian nuclear sites as soon as next month but was waved off by President Trump in recent weeks in favor of negotiating a deal with Tehran to limit its nuclear program, according to administration officials and others briefed on the discussions. Mr. Trump made his decision after months of internal debate over whether to pursue diplomacy or support Israel in seeking to set back Iran’s ability to build a bomb, at a time when Iran has been weakened militarily and economically. The debate highlighted fault lines between historically hawkish American cabinet officials and other aides more skeptical that a military assault on Iran could destroy the country’s nuclear ambitions and avoid a larger war. It resulted in a rough consensus, for now, against military action, with Iran signaling a willingness to negotiate. Israeli officials had recently developed plans to attack Iranian nuclear sites in May. They were prepared to carry them out, and at times were optimistic that the United States would sign off. The goal of the proposals, according to officials briefed on them, was to set back Tehran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon by a year or more. Almost all of the plans would have required U.S. help not just to defend Israel from Iranian retaliation, but also to ensure that an Israeli attack was successful, making the United States a central part of the attack itself. For now, Mr. Trump has chosen diplomacy over military action. In his first term, he tore up the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration. But in his second term, eager to avoid being sucked into another war in the Middle East, he has opened negotiations with Tehran, giving it a deadline of just a few months to negotiate a deal over its nuclear program.

"Researchers who have lost funds warned of long-term repercussions, but several said their school should still refuse to comply with the federal government.",2025-04-16,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Researchers who have lost funds warned of long-term repercussions, but several said their school should still refuse to comply with the federal government. By Stephanie Saul and Alan Blinder Dr. Sarah Fortune, an immunologist who spends a lot of time in her laboratory at Harvard, never expected to be caught in a battle with the White House. But early Tuesday morning, she received an official notice to “stop work” on her lab’s federally funded research on tuberculosis, an infectious disease that kills more than a million people a year worldwide. Just hours earlier, the Trump administration had vowed to freeze $2.2 billion in research funding at Harvard. If fully executed, it will be the deepest cut yet in a White House campaign against elite universities that began shortly after President Trump took office in January. Other universities, including Princeton, Cornell and Columbia, have also seen deep cuts to research funding. Dr. Fortune’s contract, a $60 million National Institutes of Health agreement involving Harvard and other universities across the country, appeared to be one of the first projects affected. Stop-work notices also began arriving this week at an obscure Harvard office called “sponsored programs” that coordinates federal research funding. One Harvard professor, David R. Walt, received a notice that his research toward a diagnostic tool for Lou Gehrig’s disease, or A.L.S., must stop immediately. Two other orders will affect research on space travel and radiation sickness, just weeks after the scientist, Dr. Donald E. Ingber, who engineers fake organs that are useful in studies of human illnesses, was approached by the government to expand his work. The Trump administration, which warned that another $7 billion may be at stake at Harvard, has framed its campaign to cut research dollars as an effort to combat antisemitism. Harvard had appeared to be seeking ways to work with the White House, until a letter to the school on Friday expanded the administration’s demands, with new requirements that had nothing to do with antisemitism.

By Hank Sanders Three people were killed and multiple others were injured Wednesday morning when two fishing boats collided in a lake in northwest Alabama during a fishing competition, the authorities said. At around 7 a.m., Joey M. Broom, 58, of Altoona, Ala., John K. Clark, 44, of Cullman, Ala., and Jeffrey C. Little, 62, of Brandon, Miss., were on a center console boat in Lewis Smith Lake in Cullman County when it collided with a bass boat, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said. The three men were thrown overboard and drowned, the law enforcement agency said. Their bodies were found in the Miller Flats area on the eastern side of the lake — a sprawling reservoir with long fingers and jagged inlets about an hour north of Birmingham. The number of injuries and their severity was not known. The coroner for Cullman County did not immediately respond to an email seeking additional information about the causes of death. The crash occurred at the beginning of the second day of the Tackle Warehouse Invitational, a competition promoted by the organization Major League Fishing. It also involved Flint Davis, a competing angler from Leesburg, Ga., the organization said. His condition was not known. The final day of the tournament, which had been scheduled for Thursday, was canceled, Major League Fishing announced. Competitors in the Tackle Warehouse Invitational try to catch the biggest bass. They are vying for a top prize of up to $115,000 as well as points to qualify for the championship invitational in September, Major League Fishing said.

"The appearance by Patty Morin came as a federal judge threatened the Trump administration with a contempt-of-court investigation over its deportation flights to El Salvador.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The appearance by Patty Morin came as a federal judge threatened the Trump administration with a contempt-of-court investigation over its deportation flights to El Salvador. By David E. Sanger David E. Sanger has covered six presidencies. Just hours after a federal judge threatened a contempt-of-court investigation over the Trump administration’s deportation flights, the White House sought to freeze the legal debate by reminding Americans of a heartbreaking case of a mother killed by an unauthorized immigrant. White House officials called a special briefing on Wednesday in the press room to bring Patty Morin, the mother of Rachel Morin, who was killed while jogging on a trail in Maryland in 2023, to the podium. She recounted in detail how her daughter, a 37-year-old mother of five, was seized, raped and bashed in the head with rocks and ultimately strangled. Members of her family also appeared at the Republican National Convention last July. An immigrant from El Salvador, Victor Martinez-Hernandez, was convicted in the case this week. The story was a tragic one, and it has fueled Mr. Trump’s arguments about dangers posed by migrants and a debate about capital punishment. Nonetheless, the invitation of Ms. Morin seemed a somewhat transparent effort to suspend the arguments about whether the administration could lawfully send migrants to El Salvador with no due process, and whether it can defy the orders of district judges who order the flights halted. Statistics show that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes on American soil than American citizens, and Mr. Trump’s claims of a wave of violent crime committed by immigrants have not been supported by police or court data. But it is a popular talking point among Mr. Trump’s base of supporters, and he often brought out family members of victims during his presidential campaign. By conflating different incidents, the Trump administration appeared to be diverting the conversation from whether his administration could defy the courts, or deny due process to those arrested and shipped out of the country to a prison the United States is paying for. Before Ms. Morin spoke, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, for traveling to El Salvador to press for the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was seized and sent to a notorious terrorist prison in El Salvador in what the government admitted was an “administrative error.” Ms. Leavitt accused him again of being a member of the MS-13 gang, a terrorist, and, in a new claim, a perpetrator of spousal abuse. She called him a “woman beater” and waved a court filing, one that sought an order of protection against him. After the briefing, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, acknowledged that she had filed the papers. But she said she had not pressed the case. “Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process,” she said. “We were able to work through this situation privately as a family.” Chris Cameron contributed reporting. David E. Sanger covers the Trump administration and a range of national security issues. He has been a Times journalist for more than four decades and has written four books on foreign policy and national security challenges.

"The move would be a major escalation of the Trump administration’s attempts to choke off federal money and support for the leading research university.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by The move would be a major escalation of the Trump administration’s attempts to choke off federal money and support for the leading research university. By Andrew Duehren and Maggie Haberman Reporting from Washington The Internal Revenue Service is weighing whether to revoke Harvard’s tax exemption, according to three people familiar with the matter, which would be a significant escalation of the Trump administration’s attempts to choke off federal money and support for the leading research university. President Trump on Tuesday publicly called for Harvard to pay taxes, continuing a standoff in which the administration has demanded the university revamp its hiring and admissions practices and its curriculum. Some I.R.S. officials have told colleagues that the Treasury Department on Wednesday asked the agency to consider revoking Harvard’s tax-exempt status, according to two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal conversations. An I.R.S. spokeswoman declined to comment. The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment. CNN first reported that the I.R.S. was looking at potentially rescinding Harvard’s tax-exempt status. Federal law bars the president from either directly or indirectly requesting the I.R.S. to investigate or audit specific targets. The I.R.S. does at times revoke tax exemptions from organizations for conducting too many political or commercial activities, but those groups can appeal the agency’s decision in court. Any attempt to take away Harvard’s tax exemption would be likely to face a legal challenge, which tax experts expect would be successful. Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said the I.R.S.’s scrutiny of Harvard began before the president’s social media post. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The Texas House approved the plan, part of a push by President Trump’s allies to offer up to about $10,000 for private school, home-school or virtual learning.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The Texas House approved the plan, part of a push by President Trump’s allies to offer up to about $10,000 for private school, home-school or virtual learning. By Dana Goldstein and J. David Goodman Dana Goldstein reported from New York, and J. David Goodman reported from Austin, Texas. The Texas House of Representatives voted early Thursday morning to create one of the largest taxpayer-funded school voucher programs, a hard-fought victory for private school choice activists as they turn their attention to a nationwide voucher push. The measure still has some legislative hurdles to clear before Gov. Greg Abbott signs it into law, but the House vote — 85 to 63 — secured a win that was decades in the making, propelled by the governor’s hardball politics last year. It was also a significant defeat for Democrats, teachers’ unions and some rural conservatives who had long worried that taxpayer-funded private-school vouchers would strain public school budgets. The program would be capped at $1 billion in its first year, but could grow quickly, potentially reaching an estimated $4.5 billion a year by 2030. The funds can be used for private school tuition and for costs associated with home-schooling, including curriculum materials and virtual learning programs. The bill was championed by an ascendant wing of the Republican Party, closely allied with President Trump and important conservative donors, including Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump’s wealthy former education secretary, and Jeff Yass, a billionaire financier from Pennsylvania and a Republican megadonor. Hours before the vote, the president spoke by phone to Mr. Abbott and Republican representatives, urging them to support the measure. “It’s a really forward-thinking vote,” Mr. Trump said, his voice heard on speakerphone. “Whatever I can do, let me know.” Those in the room cheered. “It’s time to provide a full array of options to parents,” Representative Brad Buckley, a sponsor of the bill, said from the House floor before the vote.

"Can President Trump withhold federal money for low-income students? A brewing fight over diversity, equity and inclusion programs may force the courts to decide.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Can President Trump withhold federal money for low-income students? A brewing fight over diversity, equity and inclusion programs may force the courts to decide. By Sarah Mervosh and Dana Goldstein The Trump administration is facing lawsuits and growing pushback over its demand that all 50 states end the use of what it says are illegal diversity programs in public schools or risk losing federal funding for low-income students. About a dozen mostly Democratic-leaning states including California, New York and Michigan, have refused to sign on to the administration’s directive. The nation’s two largest teachers’ unions, along with the N.A.A.C.P., are challenging the demand in federal court. Arguments in one of those cases was heard in New Hampshire on Thursday, escalating an increasingly tense standoff over the federal government’s role in local education. The Trump administration is relying on a novel interpretation of civil rights law, arguing that the Supreme Court’s decision in 2023 overturning affirmative action in college admissions also applies to K-12 public schools. Federal officials say the ruling “sets forth a framework” for the use of race in education generally. And they say it requires banning curriculum and programs that are targeted toward specific racial groups, or that center on concepts such as structural racism, the idea that racial discrimination is pervasive in the economy, law and other institutions. But that interpretation of federal law is contested by many education officials and legal scholars. “The Trump administration is trying to use a relatively narrow decision and turn it into a broad holding that brings about whatever it wishes,” said Justin Driver, a professor at Yale Law School and an expert on the Constitution and education. Now, several court cases are teed up to determine if Washington can withhold billions of federal dollars for schools to educate low-income students, a program known as Title I. Many of the nation’s poorest school districts rely heavily on the funds, but even affluent districts receive some Title I money if they serve low-income students.

The last time he met with constituents, Mr. Grassley told Iowans who filled every seat in a small meeting room, the session had devolved into a heated gripe session about President Trump’s policies. So this time, in an effort to keep things civil, Mr. Grassley, a 91-year-old Republican, had brought a written list of topics he wanted to talk about before opening the floor. “Has anybody come to talk about the farm bill?” Mr. Grassley asked hopefully, looking up from the list in his hands. They had not. Instead, for the next hour, Mr. Grassley was bombarded with complaints about Mr. Trump’s tariffs, anger about his actions on immigration, grievances over his efforts to take an ax to the federal government and frustration that the Republican-led Congress had done little to rein him in. “We would like to know what you, as the people, the Congress who are supposed to rein in this dictator — what are you going to do about it?” one man asked, gesticulating as much of the crowd applauded. After criticizing the Trump administration’s deportations, the man scowled, leaned toward Mr. Grassley and asked, “Why won’t you do your job, Senator?” The senator opened his mouth, but his tentative reply was drowned out by others echoing their disapproval.

"Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a progressive former public health official, is joining the Democratic race to succeed Senator Gary Peters, who is retiring.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a progressive former public health official, is joining the Democratic race to succeed Senator Gary Peters, who is retiring. By Katie Glueck Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a progressive former public health official from Ann Arbor, joined the Michigan Senate race on Thursday, casting himself as a populist fighter eager to mount a muscular opposition to the Trump administration. Dr. El-Sayed, a former health director in Wayne County, Mich., who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2018, is the latest entrant into a Democratic primary field that is likely to be crowded and competitive. Democrats are hoping to retain the seat, now held by Senator Gary Peters, who is retiring. “We need to break the chokehold that billionaires and oligarchs like Donald Trump and Elon Musk have on our politics and economy,” he said in a statement as he announced his candidacy. “It’s not just about what we’re fighting against. It’s about what we fight for.” Yet even as he name-checked his policy goals around the economy, the environment and guaranteed health care, Dr. El-Sayed, 40, also made clear this week that he hoped to tap into the fury of Democrats who are horrified by President Trump’s actions and frustrated with their party’s inability to curb his powers. “They want somebody who can take the fight openly, honestly and clearly and directly to Trump and Musk, but also somebody who can build from the wreckage that they leave behind,” he said in an interview, alluding in part to Mr. Musk’s efforts to gut the federal government. Of course, Republicans control the House and the Senate, and Democrats in Washington are severely limited in their ability to rein in the majority party, much less advance their own agenda.

"The university, like many colleges and charities, is exempt from property and federal income taxes, saving it billions of dollars. President Trump has questioned whether it should enjoy that status.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The university, like many colleges and charities, is exempt from federal income and property taxes, saving it billions of dollars. President Trump has questioned whether it should enjoy that status. By Matthew Mpoke Bigg and John Yoon Harvard, like many American colleges and charities, enjoys a federal tax exemption, a status granted by the Internal Revenue Service that allows the wealthy Ivy League university to forgo paying perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars a year in taxes. The I.R.S. is now weighing whether to revoke Harvard’s tax exemption, according to three people familiar with the matter, as the Trump administration demands that the university make changes to its hiring, admissions and curriculum policies. President Trump has called publicly for Harvard to pay taxes, and his administration cut $2.2 billion in federal funding to the university after it refused to submit to the administration’s pressure campaign. He raised the issue again on Friday, posting on his social media site: “We are going to be taking away Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status. It’s what they deserve!” He did not offer details. Here’s what to know about tax-exempt status: Tax-exempt status allows an organization not to pay federal income and property taxes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, which means that donations to the institution are tax-deductible. Eligible organizations include those whose purpose is “charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition and preventing cruelty to children or animals,” according to the I.R.S. The I.R.S. places a number of restrictions on any organization claiming tax-exempt status. Under the Internal Revenue Code, none of the organization’s earnings can go to a private shareholder or individual; the organization is limited in its ability to influence legislation and it cannot participate in a campaign or support political candidates.

"It will take at least until Friday to fully restore electric service after a series of failures blacked out the whole island on Wednesday, officials said.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by It will take at least until Friday to fully restore electric service after a series of failures blacked out the whole island on Wednesday, officials said. By Patricia Mazzei Reporting from Miami Nearly 65 percent of Puerto Rico’s more than 1.4 million utility customers had their power back by Thursday night, a day after a blackout knocked all of the island’s functioning power plants offline and left the entire nation in the dark. Service was unlikely to be fully restored before the early hours on Friday, Josué Colón, Puerto Rico’s energy czar, told reporters. It would take that long, he said, to get all of the island’s functional power plants back online after the systemwide shutdown. “We should have much of the population with electricity today,” Gov. Jenniffer González-Colón said Thursday afternoon. She said that one power plant had suffered serious damage, but that even so, service should be fully restored by Friday. As of 9 p.m. Thursday, more than 949,000 customers — nearly 65 percent of the total — had electricity, according to Luma Energy, the private contractor that operates the island’s power transmission system. A customer of the utility could be a house, an apartment building, a business, a government building or some other facility. Among the critical institutions that were back online Thursday were a number of hospitals and all of the island’s airports, including the airport in San Juan, the capital. The blackout occurred as a result of a series of failures in the power transmission system, Luma said, but the cause of those failures had not yet been established. The company has asked for three days to identify the likely cause. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"The Trump administration has considered sharply curtailing vouchers as part of its budget for the 2026 fiscal year.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Trump administration has considered sharply curtailing vouchers as part of its budget for the 2026 fiscal year. By Tony Romm Reporting from Washington The White House is considering deep cuts to federal housing programs, including a sweeping overhaul of aid to low-income families, in a reconfiguration that could jeopardize millions of Americans’ continued access to rental assistance funds. The potential changes primarily concern federal housing vouchers, including those more commonly known as Section 8. The aid generally helps the poorest tenants cover the monthly costs of apartments, town homes and single-family residences. Administration officials recently discussed cutting or canceling out the vouchers and other rental assistance programs and potentially replacing them with a more limited system of housing grants, perhaps sent to states, according to three people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the confidential discussions. The overhaul would be included in President Trump’s new budget, which is expected to be sent to Capitol Hill in the coming weeks. The exact design and cost of the retooled program is unclear, and any such change is likely to require approval from Congress, as White House budgets on their own do not carry the force of law. But people familiar with the administration’s thinking said the expected overhaul would most likely amount to more than just a technical change, resulting in fewer federal dollars for low-income families on top of additional cuts planned for the rest of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. On Thursday, the Trump administration took the first steps toward potentially selling the agency’s headquarters in Washington. Federal voucher programs currently provide assistance to about 2.3 million low-income families, according to the government’s estimates, who enroll through their local public-housing authorities. The aid is part of a broader universe of rental assistance programs that are set to exceed $54 billion this fiscal year. But the annual demand for these subsidies is far greater than the available funds, creating a sizable wait list as rents are rising nationally. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Four men casually rode their horses up and down the aisles in Louisiana.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Four men casually rode their horses up and down the aisles in Louisiana. By Victor Mather A stapler? Sure, that will be in office supplies. Go past kitchen appliances and men’s work shoes, and turn left at the four guys riding horses. Shoppers at a Walmart in the town of Baker, La., on the outskirts of Baton Rouge, were startled last week — and we’re talking “Oh, hell no” startled — when they saw four gentlemen casually rambling through the aisles on horseback. A video of the equine incursion shows the saddled and mounted horses calmly walking through the store, seemingly unperturbed by blue-shirted employees, bargain-hunters and reasonably priced goods. Four people accused of being the riders now face charges including disturbing the peace. One of the accused, Brendon Bridgewater, said of his group of horsemen, “We do certain things, and everyone’s watching.” Noting the attention that the stunts and videos receive, he said, “You’ve got to be able to put yourself out there.” “A lot of people are talking about it,” he added. Unfortunately for the group, a 2024 Louisiana law forbids a person involved in a crime to post an image or video of the crime “for the purpose of gaining notoriety, publicity or the attention of the public.” The four suspects were charged with unlawful posting of criminal activity, as well as entering and remaining after being forbidden and disturbing the peace, Carl Dunn, chief of the Baker Police Department, told The Advocate of Baton Rouge.

By Hamed AleazizLuke Broadwater and Stephanie Saul Hamed Aleaziz and Luke Broadwater reported from Washington, and Stephanie Saul from New York. The Trump administration has threatened to block Harvard University from enrolling international students unless the school hands over detailed records about the student body, in another escalation of the federal government’s fight against higher education. In a letter sent on Wednesday, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, asked for “relevant information” on each student visa holder at Harvard who had been involved in “known illegal” or “dangerous” activity. She also requested information on the coursework of student visa holders, to verify that they had taken enough classes to “maintain nonimmigrant student status.” “It is a privilege to have foreign students attend Harvard University, not a guarantee,” Ms. Noem wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times. “The United States government understands that Harvard University relies heavily on foreign student funding from over 10,000 foreign students to build and maintain their substantial endowment.” The university, Ms. Noem added, “has created a hostile learning environment for Jewish students” because of its “failure to condemn antisemitism.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By David E. Sanger Reporting from the White House The Oval Office bargaining over tariffs is accelerating. A day after a Japanese delegation met with President Trump, it was Italy’s turn, with the White House arrival on Thursday of one of the few European leaders Mr. Trump likes: Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. As Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance made clear at a lunch for Ms. Meloni in the Cabinet Room and a session in the Oval Office, they want her conservative, more nationalistic views to become a model for the rest of Europe. For her part, Ms. Meloni appeared adept at handling an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump: no demands that might lead to a blowup like President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine faced, just praise for Mr. Trump and odes to his favorite causes. “The goal for me is to make the West great again,” she said, getting in the message that there was no room in the two leaders’ spheres for diversity programs or “woke ideology,” before pivoting to inviting Mr. Trump to Italy for an official visit. She suggested she might use the moment to get the president to sit down with the leaders of Europe, though she acknowledged that Mr. Trump was noncommittal. While Ms. Meloni came to Washington representing Italy, her visit was in many ways on behalf of the rest of Europe, as it seeks more lasting relief from Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

By Katie Glueck Former Vice President Kamala Harris, the 2024 Democratic nominee, is scheduled to headline a fund-raiser for the Democratic National Committee next month as she accelerates her re-engagement with the political world after her defeat last fall. The event is scheduled for May 6 in New York, according to an invitation reviewed by The New York Times. It is billed as a discussion between Ms. Harris and Ken Martin, the chairman of the D.N.C. Tickets start at $25,000, a level of access called “building the opposition.” The $44,300 level is called “fighting for the future,” according to the invitation. The event comes as Ms. Harris slowly begins to wade back into the political arena, five months after President Trump prevailed in their truncated general-election matchup. Ms. Harris has been weighing her next moves, which could include a return to the campaign trail, whether as a presidential candidate in 2028 or as a candidate for governor in her home state of California next year. Some of her closest allies believe she is leaning toward the California run, while Ms. Harris has told people that she can run for governor or president, but not both. Indeed, the 2028 presidential campaign will effectively begin the day after the 2026 midterm elections end, if not sooner. For now, though, Ms. Harris has been far less visible than some other Democrats, who have blanketed podcasts and town-hall events in red-leaning states in their efforts to push back against Mr. Trump. That list includes her former running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. Others are also ramping up their appearances at the party’s events. Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, for instance, is scheduled to headline a major New Hampshire Democratic Party event in Manchester this month. Katie Glueck is a Times national political reporter.

The gunman was identified as the son of a deputy in the local sheriff’s department, and was taken into custody after being shot by the police, law enforcement officials said. Officials said that the gunman, identified as Phoenix Ikner, was armed with a former service revolver of his mother, a deputy who has worked at the Leon County Sheriff’s Office for 18 years and was allowed to keep the gun for personal use. Mr. Ikner had been involved in training programs at the Sheriff’s Office and was a member of its youth advisory committee, Sheriff Walter McNeil told reporters. “He has been steeped in the Leon County Sheriff’s Office family,” the sheriff said. “It’s not a surprise to us that he had access to weapons.” Chief Lawrence E. Revell of the Tallahassee Police Department said Mr. Ikner also had a shotgun with him, but Chief Revell said he was not sure that gun was used in the attack.

"Out of power in Congress, Democrats who were slow to fight back against President Trump are increasingly finding ways to do so. But activists want much more.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Out of power in Congress, Democrats who were slow to fight back against President Trump are increasingly finding ways to do so. But activists want much more. By Annie Karni Reporting from Washington Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, has a mantra for the second Trump era: “A rally a day keeps the fascists away.” Mr. Raskin, who developed a following for his role on the House select committee on the Jan. 6 attack, has attended 52 rallies and marches since President Trump’s inauguration, and regularly speaks at town halls in red districts where Republicans are no longer showing up. “There’s a regime of fear that’s been brought down on society,” Mr. Raskin said in an interview. “People need to see leaders and organizers standing up and speaking with authority against what’s happening.” As Mr. Trump approaches the 100th day of his presidency, Democratic leaders in Congress, who were slow out of the gate to stand up to a president unbound, are beginning to find ways of using what little leverage they have to fight back. Hundreds of lawmakers have signed onto half-a-dozen court briefs challenging Mr. Trump’s unlawful executive directives; others have held “shadow” hearings highlighting administration moves that have trampled on the rule of law and eliminated crucial federal programs. In the Senate, they have used rules to slow down the confirmation of some lower-level administration officials. Even when they are destined to lose, some Democratic lawmakers have succeeded in spotlighting their resistance to the administration. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey drew outsize attention with a record-breaking, 25-hour speech on the Senate floor, a physical feat of stamina and bladder control that resonated widely — racking up millions of likes on TikTok — even if it did not actually block the president from doing anything.

"The Trump administration had asked the justices to lift a nationwide pause on the policy as lower court challenges continue.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Trump administration had asked the justices to lift a nationwide pause on the policy as lower court challenges continue. By Abbie VanSickle Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court announced on Thursday that it would hear arguments in a few weeks over President Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The brief order by the justices was unsigned and gave no reasoning, as is typical in such emergency cases. But the unusual move is a sign that the justices consider the matter significant enough that they would immediately hold oral argument on the government’s request to lift a nationwide pause on the policy. The justices announced they would defer any consideration of the temporary block on the policy until they heard oral arguments, which they set for May 15. That means that the executive order, which would end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and foreign residents, will remain paused in every state while the court considers the case. The order was the latest response to a series of emergency applications brought by the Trump administration to challenge lower court blocks on a number of policies, including efforts to freeze more than a billion dollars in foreign aid and the deportation of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador without due process. In three emergency applications, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to find that lower courts had erred in imposing bans on the birthright citizenship policy that extended beyond the parties involved in the litigation. It did not ask the court to weigh in on the constitutionality of that executive order, which was challenged soon after it was signed. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

The Robert C. Weaver Federal Building in Washington has been added to a list of properties that the administration says it is trying to offload in order to eliminate waste.

They added that staying in the Washington region was a “top priority.” Scott Turner, the housing secretary, has said that the headquarters are “in disrepair,” and that he wants to create an environment “where our people want to come work.” The agency’s focus, he said in a statement Thursday, was on “a workplace that reflects the values of efficiency, accountability and purpose.” Federal officials also said that the number of housing department staff members assigned to work in the headquarters amounted to only around half of the building’s capacity. The department has been considering additional cuts to its work force as part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to shrink the federal bureaucracy.

"The men had their death sentences commuted under the Biden administration, but say they are being punished by being transferred from a prison in Indiana to a restrictive federal prison in Colorado.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The men had their death sentences commuted under the Biden administration, but say they are being punished by being transferred from a prison in Indiana to a restrictive federal prison in Colorado. By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs A group of condemned prisoners whose lives were spared by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are now suing the federal government, arguing that Trump administration officials are unfairly trying to transfer them to one of the country’s harshest federal prisons. The 21 men who joined the lawsuit are among 37 prisoners who had their death sentences commuted by Mr. Biden in one of his last acts in office. They are currently being held at a federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., where the federal government has long held death row prisoners and where Mr. Trump had 13 prisoners executed during his first term in office. Now, they say, the Trump administration is carrying out a “sham process” to move them to the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colo., often referred to as A.D.X. It is considered the most restrictive federal prison in the nation and the only federal “supermax” prison; experts and former prisoners have described being held there as living in nearly complete isolation. The proposed transfer follows a series of events that began with Mr. Biden canceling the death sentences of all but three prisoners on federal death row in December, converting 37 of them to terms of life in prison. On Jan. 20, the day Mr. Trump began his second term, he issued an executive order urging his incoming attorney general to pursue the death penalty for offenses severe enough to warrant it and to encourage prosecutors across the country to do so as well. Key to the prisoners’ new lawsuit, in January Mr. Trump also ordered his incoming attorney general to “evaluate the places of imprisonment” for those whose sentences were commuted by Mr. Biden and ensure that they are “imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.” In February, a day after Pam Bondi was confirmed as attorney general, she issued a memo directing the Bureau of Prisons to evaluate where the prisoners Mr. Biden had commuted should be held.

"A Treasury Department official wrote to the I.R.S. that Mike Lindell, the pillow entrepreneur, was “concerned he may have been inappropriately targeted.”",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by A Treasury Department official wrote to the I.R.S. that Mike Lindell, the pillow entrepreneur, was “concerned he may have been inappropriately targeted.” By Andrew Duehren Reporting from Washington A Trump administration official last month asked the Internal Revenue Service to look into concerns from Mike Lindell, the pillow entrepreneur and a leading denier of the 2020 presidential election, that he had been inappropriately targeted for an audit, according to three people familiar with the matter and an email viewed by The New York Times. David Eisner, a Treasury official, wrote an email in March to a top I.R.S. official that Mr. Lindell, “a high-profile friend of the President recently received an audit letter, from what I understand, his second in two years.” Mr. Eisner wrote that Mr. Lindell “is concerned that he may have been inappropriately targeted” and then signed off the message. I.R.S. officials did not act on the email, and instead referred it to the agency’s inspector general, according to the people. But the message alarmed agency staff that President Trump hoped to use the tax collector to protect his friends and allies from normal scrutiny, concerns that have only grown as the Trump administration clears out agency leadership and pushes it to carry out Mr. Trump’s directions.  “David Eisner is a dedicated public servant, and he acted appropriately with the expectation that this would be sent to the inspector general,” a Treasury spokesperson said. “Sharing relevant information with nonpartisan inspectors general is designed to be an effective and confidential way to help ensure all Americans are treated fairly.” In an interview, Mr. Lindell said that Mr. Eisner’s message reflected a mix-up. Mr. Lindell said he had reached out to Treasury officials about why companies should have to amend previous tax years’ returns after receiving the employee retention tax credit, a pandemic-era benefit. “It’s nonsensical government waste and I really want to try and get this rectified,” he said. Mr. Lindell said he had also faced an I.R.S. inquiry over when he could write off the cost of a Covid-19 drug he tried to sell during the pandemic. “It’s pending their decision,” he said. “The I.R.S. is very slow in making the decision.” Mr. Lindell met with Mr. Trump at the White House earlier this year. He has faced several defamation lawsuits stemming from his claims that the 2020 election was stolen, and federal agents seized his phone in 2022. Beyond shielding Mr. Trump’s friends, the Trump administration has pushed the I.R.S. to investigate his political targets, including by asking it to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status. The administration earlier this month also enlisted the I.R.S. to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement deport undocumented immigrants.

"Some worried liberal donors and the nonprofit groups they support are getting “legal teams on speed dial, crisis plans dusted off, reserves lined up.”",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Some worried liberal donors and the nonprofit groups they support are getting “legal teams on speed dial, crisis plans dusted off, reserves lined up.” By Theodore Schleifer and Lisa Friedman Reporting from Washington The close-knit world of liberal donors and the nonprofit groups they support has spent the last week in a state of fear and anxiety, worried that any day now, President Trump could go after their assets or their tax-exempt status. But it all seemed purely speculative — until Thursday. In an impromptu news conference in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump confirmed that he was potentially seeking to pull Harvard’s tax-exempt status, in an apparent act of retaliation for the university’s refusal to bow to a long list of demands. And he said there “could be” others, suggesting that the Internal Revenue Service could also take action against organizations that support immigrants or the environment. “Tax-exempt status, that’s a privilege. It’s really a privilege,” Mr. Trump said. “And it’s been abused. By a lot more than Harvard.” Ever since Mr. Trump won back power in November, donors have been sweating that a president dead-set on retribution would go after them in personal ways. And so while some of these donors and their allied groups have cozied up to the Trump administration, more of them have worked diligently to lie low, de-emphasizing viewpoints that could attract scrutiny, such as on diversity, equity and inclusion. “The fear is real,” said Tim Lim, a progressive fund-raiser who said he had held several conversations in the last 24 hours with worried leaders of such groups. “If the Trump administration is successful in removing Harvard’s tax-exempt status, then they could use this same blueprint against every progressive nonprofit.” At his news conference on Thursday, Mr. Trump specifically targeted Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit watchdog group focused on corruption. The group, known as CREW, has issued multiple reports about the Trump administration, including on its seeming defiance of court orders and Mr. Trump’s personal conflicts of interest.

"The end of the Assad era has reduced some threats, but the Islamic State has shown renewed strength in the country.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Syria After Civil War Advertisement Supported by The end of the Assad era has reduced some threats, but the Islamic State has shown renewed strength in the country. By Eric Schmitt Reporting from Washington The United States has started drawing down hundreds of troops from northeastern Syria, a reflection of the shifting security environment in the country since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad in December, but also a move that carries risks. The military is shuttering three of its eight small operating bases in the country’s northeast, reducing troop levels to about 1,400 from 2,000, two senior U.S. officials said. The bases are Mission Support Site Green Village, M.S.S. Euphrates and a third much smaller facility. After 60 days, the officials said, American commanders will assess whether to make additional cuts. Commanders have recommended keeping at least 500 U.S. troops in Syria, one of the officials said. President Trump, however, has expressed deep skepticism about keeping any U.S. troops in the country. At least for now the reductions that started on Thursday are based on ground commanders’ recommendations to close and consolidate bases, and were approved by the Pentagon and its Central Command, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational matters. The Islamic State remains a potent danger in Syria, particularly in the northeast where American troops are concentrated. But the demise of Mr. Assad’s regime has greatly reduced, at least for now, an array of other threats, including the Iran-backed militias and Russian troops that supported the Syrian government. Another major turning point came last month when the Kurdish-led militia that controls northeastern Syria agreed to merge with the country’s new government, a breakthrough for Damascus in its efforts to unify a country still wrestling with violent turmoil.

"An internal memo proposes carving out $40 billion from federal health agencies while eliminating dozens of programs. Congress has ultimate appropriation authority.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by An internal memo proposes carving out $40 billion from federal health agencies while eliminating dozens of programs. Congress has ultimate appropriation authority. By Karoun Demirjian and Apoorva Mandavilli The Trump administration is eyeing about $40 billion in cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services’s budget next year, according to a memo obtained by The New York Times, as the White House charges ahead with plans for drastic changes to the agencies that regulate food and drugs, protect Americans from disease and research new treatments. The proposed cuts laid out in the preliminary budget memo would reduce the department’s budget from about $121 billion to about $80.4 billion. The document also proposes eliminating dozens of programs focused on various public health challenges, such as autism, teen pregnancy, lead poisoning, opioid recovery and support for rural hospitals. The memo was first reported by The Washington Post. The cuts deal with discretionary H.H.S. funding, not what the federal government is obligated by law to spend annually on insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which insure nearly half of Americans. While it is not yet clear if the Trump administration will pursue all of the cuts the document outlines, it is Congress that will decide whether to enact them, as the legislature appropriates the federal government’s funding. Still, the memo reveals how President Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, might put into practice their plans to overhaul the department and refashion it as a crucible for Mr. Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement. About a quarter of the funds that would survive the proposed cuts would be directed toward the Administration for a Healthy America, a new $20 billion effort that would oversee agencies focused on H.I.V. and AIDS, maternal and child health, environmental health, mental health and primary care.

"The threat of investigations into whether the administration violated the judges’ orders comes as President Trump and his advisers are increasingly butting heads with the courts.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by News Analysis The threat of investigations into whether the administration violated the judges’ orders comes as President Trump and his advisers are increasingly butting heads with the courts. By Alan Feuer After the Trump administration rushed nearly 240 Central American immigrants onto charter planes last month and flew them — most without hearings — to a prison in El Salvador, the courts responded with a flurry of orders more or less instructing Trump officials to figure out a way to give them the due process they had been denied. But for much of the past few weeks, the White House has dodged, dragged its feet and found other ways to defy some of those orders. And that has led to a remarkable development. Two federal judges in Washington and Maryland handling cases arising from the deportation flights have now declared that they have reason to believe that Trump officials have acted in bad faith by failing to comply with their decrees. To get to the bottom of the obfuscation, the judges have made plans for searching inquiries into who in the administration may have been responsible. The threat of the investigations has come at an especially fraught moment: just as President Trump and his advisers are increasingly butting heads with the courts and are testing the traditional balance of power between the judicial and executive branches. The jurists’ dual moves have brought the two coequal parts of the government closer than ever to an open confrontation. The prospect of that rift has become so glaring that it made its way on Thursday into an almost mournful order regarding one of the deportation cases written by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a conservative Reagan appointee, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Virginia. The purpose of the order was to reaffirm that the White House needed to play a more active role in seeking the release of a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was flown last month to a prison in El Salvador, despite a court order expressly forbidding him from being sent there.

By Alan Feuer A federal appeals court in Virginia reaffirmed on Thursday that the White House needed to play a more active role in seeking the release of a Maryland man who was deported last month to a prison in El Salvador, despite a court order expressly forbidding that he be sent there. In a sternly worded ruling, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit expressed exasperation at the Trump administration’s continued recalcitrance in refusing to help free the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. “The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,” Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote on behalf of the panel. “Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.” The panel’s decision came in response to a request by the Justice Department to pause an order issued last week by Judge Paula Xinis directing the administration to follow instructions from the Supreme Court to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release from the prison in El Salvador. At a hearing on Tuesday in front of Judge Xinis in Federal District Court in Maryland, Justice Department lawyers offered an exceedingly narrow definition of “facilitate,” suggesting that all the White House had to do to comply with the Supreme Court’s directives was let Mr. Abrego Garcia into the United States if he somehow managed to make it to the border. But the appellate panel disagreed, saying that “‘facilitate’ is an active verb” and does not “allow the government to do essentially nothing.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Robert Jimison Robert Jimison, who covers Congress, traveled with Senator Chris Van Hollen to El Salvador. Senator Chris Van Hollen said on Thursday night that he had met in San Salvador with Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man whose wrongful deportation to El Salvador last month has become a flashpoint in the immigration debate and fueled a standoff between the Trump administration and the courts. Mr. Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, shared a photo of the two men speaking on Thursday evening, hours after the senator had been denied entry to the prison where Mr. Abrego Garcia was being held. The unexpected meeting took place at a hotel in San Salvador, according to photos shared by the senator’s office late Thursday. In the images, Mr. Abrego Garcia was dressed in plainclothes and sat for a conversation with Mr. Van Hollen. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, said on social media that Mr. Abrego Garcia would remain in his country’s custody. The photos shared by Mr. Van Hollen and others posted by Mr. Bukele were the first public glimpses of Mr. Abrego Garcia since his deportation in March, which the Trump administration admitted in court was an error. The Supreme Court has ordered the administration to “facilitate” his return, but a federal judge overseeing the case has scolded the government for doing “nothing” to comply. “Our purpose today was very straightforward,” Mr. Van Hollen said in an interview on Thursday, before the meeting with Mr. Abrego Garcia. “It was simply to be able to go see if Kilmar Abrego Garcia is doing OK. I mean, nobody has heard anything about his condition since he was illegally abducted from the United States. He is totally beyond reach.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Choice laws have now passed in every major Republican state. Congress and President Trump are now aiming at blue states that have resisted vouchers for decades.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Choice laws have now passed in every major Republican state. Congress and President Trump are now aiming at blue states that have resisted vouchers for decades. By Dana Goldstein and Sarah Mervosh With a big win for school vouchers in Texas in the early hours of Thursday morning, the private-school choice movement conquered the last major Republican-led state. Next up, the rest of the country. Voucher advocates will now turn their attention to Washington, D.C., where Republican allies are advancing a bill that could force the concept even on Democratic states that have resisted for decades. In President Trump and Republican leaders in Congress, voucher proponents have friends in the highest of places. They also have a plan for a federal private-school choice program that could pass this year with simple majorities in the House and the Senate. “It’s a monumental and cascading moment for the school choice movement,” said Tommy Schultz, chief executive of the American Federation for Children, a private-school choice advocacy group. In recent years, the nation’s Republican-dominated and Democratic-dominated states have gone their separate ways on fundamental issues such as abortion rights, health insurance, climate change and energy policy. On education, red states, in a remarkable procession, have adopted measures to use taxpayer dollars to finance private school tuition and home-schooling. In many cases, Washington has let the states drift apart. Vouchers might be different. A national bill would bring private-school choice to states where Democrats and teachers’ unions have always been successful in quashing the concept, contending that vouchers could drain resources from public education, diminish learning standards and leave the most disadvantaged children warehoused in poorly funded public schools. The federal legislation is structured as a $10 billion tax credit for donations to nonprofit groups that offer private-education scholarships, and as such, it could be included as part of a giant budget reconciliation bill expected to be assembled this summer. If so, it would need only 51 votes in a Senate where Republicans hold 53 seats. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"The campus, where a gunman killed two people on Thursday, experienced another shooting over a decade ago that left three people injured.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Florida State University Shooting Advertisement Supported by The campus, where a gunman killed two people on Thursday, experienced another shooting over a decade ago that left three people injured. By Eduardo Medina Florida State University, where a gunman killed two people and injured six others on Thursday, has been haunted by gun violence before. In 2014, a gunman shot three people at a library on campus before he was killed by the police. In that shooting, a burst of gunfire sent hundreds of bystanders fleeing or hiding among bookshelves at Strozier Library in the middle of the fall semester. The gunman, a 31-year-old graduate named Myron May, wounded two students and a library employee who survived. The gunman had reloaded once before he was killed by the police outside the library building, the authorities said at the time. The gunman had believed the government was watching him, and that he had detailed his fears in a written journal and videos, officials said at the time. He had no criminal record with the Tallahassee Police Department or the Leon County Sheriff’s Office, the authorities said in 2014. The police chief at the time, Michael DeLeo, credited security measures that allowed only students and staff to enter the library with preventing more bloodshed. The gunman had been carrying a .38-caliber handgun and additional ammunition in his pockets, but he left the library after he was unable to make it past the security barriers, Chief DeLeo said then. One of the students who was injured, Farhan Ahmed, was left paralyzed after the shooting, according to WTXL, a TV station in Tallahassee. In 2019, Florida State University and Mr. Ahmed reached a $1 million settlement, The Tallahassee Democrat reported. Eduardo Medina is a Times reporter covering the South.

"Lisa Murkowski, a longtime senator from Alaska and an independent voice in an increasingly tribal party, has been the rare Republican on Capitol Hill willing to criticize President Trump’s actions.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Lisa Murkowski, a longtime senator from Alaska and an independent voice in an increasingly tribal party, has been the rare Republican on Capitol Hill willing to criticize President Trump’s actions. By Annie Karni  Senator Lisa Murkowski, the moderate Alaska Republican who has routinely broken with her party to criticize President Trump, has made a startling admission about the reality of serving in public office at a time when an unbound leader in the Oval Office is bent on retribution against his political foes. “We are all afraid,” Ms. Murkowski said, speaking at a conference in Anchorage on Monday. After pausing for about five seconds, she acknowledged: “It’s quite a statement. But we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been here before. I’ll tell you, I’m oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that’s not right.” Ms. Murkowski’s comments were first reported by The Anchorage Daily News. Ms. Murkowski, an independent voice in an increasingly tribal party, has been the rare Republican on Capitol Hill willing to criticize the Trump administration. After Mr. Trump in February berated President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in the Oval Office, she warned that the United States was “walking away from our allies.” She has routinely criticized the Department of Government Efficiency for creating a “tremendous amount of unnecessary anxiety” and for firing federal workers in her state. And Ms. Murkowski was one of only three Republicans who voted not to confirm Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Ms. Murkowski has become more outspoken in Mr. Trump’s second term, but she has long been part of a small minority in her party willing to stand up to its leader at a time when most G.O.P. lawmakers have chosen to fall in line. She was one of seven Republicans who voted in 2021 to convict Mr. Trump in his second impeachment trial, and the only one up for re-election at the time. She was also one of three Republicans who voted to support Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation to the Supreme Court. Ms. Murkowski has been upfront about her discomfort in a party led by Mr. Trump, whom she said she refused to vote for last year; Ms. Murkowski endorsed former Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina for president. At the time, Ms. Murkowski even considered leaving the party altogether, although she has not done so. “I just regret that our party is seemingly becoming a party of Donald Trump,” she told CNN last year. When asked if she would leave it and become an independent, she said that she was “navigating my way through some very interesting political times. Let’s just leave it at that.” On Monday in Anchorage, Ms. Murkowski said she did not plan to stop speaking out, even if she was frightened of retaliation. “That’s what you’ve asked me to do,” she said, referring to her constituents. “I’m going to use my voice to the best of my ability.” She added: “I have to figure out how I can do my best to help the many who are so anxious and are so afraid.” Ms. Murkowski, a fourth-term senator, is up for re-election in 2028.

By Tim Arango and Matt Stevens Tim Arango reported from inside Los Angeles Superior Court. Matt Stevens reported from Los Angeles. It was supposed to be Lyle and Erik Menendez’s big day. Family members had flown in from around the country. An old buddy from prison came to town from Kansas City to testify on their behalf. Dozens of television cameras were positioned in the plaza outside the courthouse. But instead of a hearing that could have led to their being released from prison, the proceeding devolved into rancor and confusion and ended with another delay. On Thursday, a Los Angeles judge pushed back their highly awaited resentencing hearing, delaying the proceedings yet again in order to decide whether a key report on the brothers was admissible. A two-day resentencing hearing had been set to begin on Thursday in a packed courtroom in Los Angeles Superior Court. Now, a procedural hearing is scheduled for May 9. The court will grapple with the report and other matters before moving on to hear testimony about a potential resentencing. The judge said part of the hearing on May 9 could be closed to the public. At issue: Whether the brothers should walk free more than 35 years after they murdered their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in the den of their Beverly Hills mansion. The brothers have long said they did so because they were sexually abused by their father and feared that their parents would kill them to prevent the family’s secrets from being disclosed. They were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. A new, lesser sentence could see the brothers freed imminently.

"The Trump administration is on course for a potential constitutional clash with the judiciary branch, which has issued several rulings countering executive orders.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The Trump administration is on course for a potential constitutional clash with the judiciary branch, which has issued several rulings countering executive orders. By Alan Feuer and Abbie VanSickle A number of major cases challenging President Trump’s initial moves on immigration are making their way through the legal system. Mr. Trump has moved aggressively to detain and deport migrants, but a series of his moves have been challenged in court. In a number of those cases, federal judges have responded by ordering the Trump administration to give due process to people being deported. The administration has dragged its feet to avoid some of those rulings, setting up a potential constitutional clash between the executive and judiciary branches. Here’s a look at where some of the biggest cases stand, and what comes next. On his first day back in office, Mr. Trump issued an executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and foreign residents. Birthright citizenship, the guarantee that a person born in the United States is automatically a citizen, has long been considered a central tenet of the United States. The 14th Amendment, which was ratified after the Civil War, declares that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” The Supreme Court affirmed the guarantee of automatic citizenship for nearly all children born in the United States in 1898 in the case of Wong Kim Ark, where the justices found that under the 14th Amendment, Mr. Wong, who was born in 1873 to Chinese parents living in San Francisco, was a U.S. citizen. The order prompted a flurry of lawsuits, including challenges by Democratic attorneys general and civil rights groups. Federal courts in Massachusetts, Maryland and Washington State issued temporary directives that paused the order for the entire country while court challenges continued. One federal judge called the order “blatantly unconstitutional.” The Trump administration pushed back against the nationwide pause on the policy, filing an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. The administration asked the court to lift the pause and allow the policy to go into effect in states that had not challenged it. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Neil Vigdor and Adeel Hassan It was not the first time some of them had barricaded themselves in a room at school. The sight of law enforcement officers in tactical gear, sweeping campus for a gunman, was familiar. So was the fear for several students who sheltered in place during Thursday’s deadly shooting at Florida State University and shared a traumatizing coincidence: They had endured the Parkland, Fla., school massacre in 2018. Joshua Gallagher, a law student at Florida State who went to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, wrote on social media on Thursday that he never thought that gun violence would hit close to home again. “Then I’m in the FSU Law Library,” where he heard an alarm: “active shooter on campus,” Mr. Gallagher wrote on X. “No matter your politics, we need to meet — and something has to change.” Ilana Badiner, 21, who is graduating from Florida State in two weeks, said in an interview that she huddled in the student union basement with about 30 people during the shooting. In 2018, she was a student at a school adjacent to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. She said her school had been placed on lockdown for four hours. “It was the same situation today, where people were just on the phones calling everybody and there were people crying,” she said. “It’s terrible that this keeps happening.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The agency, which has returned $21 billion to consumers since its inception, could lose 1,500 of its 1,700 employees, a union warned.",2025-04-17,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The agency, which has returned $21 billion to consumers since its inception, could lose 1,500 of its 1,700 employees, a union warned. By Stacy Cowley The Trump administration sent layoff notices on Thursday to a large swath of employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, just days after a federal appeals court pared back an injunction that had prevented the agency’s leaders from carrying out plans to fire nearly all of the bureau’s workers. The full scope of the cuts was not immediately clear, but by late afternoon, hundreds of workers across all of the agency’s major divisions had received reduction-in-force notices. Fired employees were told they would lose access to their email accounts and the agency’s work systems on Friday evening. A legal filing Thursday evening by the consumer bureau’s staff union estimated that the terminations could hit as many as 1,500 of the bureau’s 1,700 employees. “Entire offices, including statutorily mandated ones, have or soon will be either eliminated or reduced to a single person,” the union said in its filing to the Federal District Court in Washington. The notice of the layoffs appeared to immediately catch the attention of the district judge in the case, Amy Berman Jackson, who set an 11 a.m. hearing on Friday to determine whether the government had violated her injunction to halt the dismantling of the agency. She ordered the bureau to produce an official “with personal knowledge” of the scope of the layoffs and the decision to implement them for the hearing. Representatives of the consumer bureau did not respond to a request for comment. The bureau, which was created by Congress in 2011, monitors banks and other lenders. Since it was established, the watchdog agency has returned $21 billion to defrauded consumers through refunds and debt cancellation, according to government figures. On Wednesday, Mark Paoletta, the agency’s chief legal officer, sent an all-staff memo laying out new priorities. The bureau will significantly reduce its enforcement and compliance examination work, and “deprioritize” oversight of student loans, medical debt, digital payments and peer-to-peer lending, he wrote.

"The Trump administration said it would take $2.2 billion in research funds from the school. Some small donors are doing their best to make up for the shortfall.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The Trump administration said it would take $2.2 billion in research funds from the school. Some small donors are doing their best to make up for the shortfall. By Vimal Patel For two decades after graduating from Harvard, Samuel Graham-Felsen never donated to his alma mater. The 388-year-old university represented elitism, he said. Giving even more money to the world’s wealthiest school didn’t align with his values. “Why should I be giving to this place that has billions of dollars?” he asked himself when he received fund-raising notices. His sentiment changed this week, after the university rejected a series of demands from the Trump administration. The government asked Harvard to do a host of things — like auditing professors’ work for plagiarism and reporting international students who break rules to federal authorities — that outraged the school’s leaders, others in higher education and people far beyond its iron gates. Within hours, the federal government responded with a $2.2 billion funding freeze, and later in the week said it would try to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status. The Trump administration has said it is targeting Harvard because it has not done enough to combat antisemitism. That did not sit well with Mr. Graham-Felsen, a novelist and freelance writer in New Jersey, who is Jewish. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Employees of AmeriCorps who were put on administrative leave include all those who work for a national disaster response program.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Employees of AmeriCorps who were put on administrative leave include all those who work for a national disaster response program. By Aishvarya Kavi Reporting from Washington The independent federal agency that organizes community service work in the United States has placed on administrative leave almost all of its federal staff at the direction of Elon Musk’s cost-cutting team, according to people familiar with developments at the agency. Those on leave include all of the employees of a national disaster response program, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information they provided. A majority of federal employees at the agency, which is known as AmeriCorps, received emails on Wednesday with an attached memo, dated April 16, from the interim head of the agency, Jennifer Bastress Tahmasebi. The memo told them they were placed on administrative leave with pay, effective immediately, according to two copies reviewed by The New York Times. It also directed them not to return to AmeriCorps property or access its systems. The changes at AmeriCorps come as Mr. Musk’s team, called the Department of Government Efficiency, has moved to shutter agencies, including those with missions cast into law by Congress, in a bid to cut what it calls excess federal spending. As with other agencies affected as part of Mr. Musk’s effort, only a small fraction of AmeriCorps employees remained at the headquarters in Washington on Thursday. The expected cuts could gut the agency’s response work in regions decimated by recent natural disasters, including areas in the Southeastern United States that were wiped out by Hurricane Helene. An administration official confirmed on Thursday that roughly 75 percent of full-time AmeriCorps employees were placed on administrative leave, and noted that the agency’s $1 billion budget, which the official suggested was mismanaged, was appropriately targeted in President Trump’s bid to eliminate waste.

By Jenna Russell and Miles J. Herszenhorn For four days, Harvard University’s name had been in the headlines, heroic to some, villainous to others — after the nation’s oldest institution of higher learning stood up and said no to the demands of President Trump, and then suffered his wrath. But when leaders of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health convened a town hall meeting on Thursday morning, resistance or acquiescence was not the question of the moment, nor was defiance the prevailing mood. The school’s leaders laid out their dire financial circumstances to a stunned and overwhelmed audience of about 1,000 students and faculty and staff members, near the end of a week of unprecedented federal aggression. They had no good news to share. “It’s like you’re hunkering down for the beginning of a war, where you think you’re going to be losing a lot of your freedoms and a lot of your resources,” said Steve Gortmaker, director of the school’s Prevention Research Center on Nutrition and Physical Activity, who attended the meeting. With Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, standing toe-to-toe with the president of the United States, faculty members and students on the Cambridge campus on Thursday said they were struggling to make sense of the rapid escalation this week of Mr. Trump’s campaign to bend the university to his will. After Mr. Garber rejected Mr. Trump’s demands, the White House moved swiftly to inflict punishment, freezing $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard on Monday, suggesting on Wednesday it would revoke Harvard’s tax exemption, and then threatening to block the university from enrolling international students. In Harvard Yard, students still hurried to class; tourists still lined up under flowering trees to take photos of a statue of John Harvard. But behind the scenes, professors and researchers acknowledged a rising tide of angst, anger and uncertainty, their pride in the university’s stand against federal intervention mingling with their dread of the painful consequences.

Routinely, and often at Mr. Trump’s enthusiastic direction, senior administration officials and allied pastors are infusing their brand of Christian worship into the workings of the White House itself, suggesting that his campaign promise to “bring back Christianity” is taking tangible root. The result at times is an atmosphere inside the White House of a president operating with a divine mission. Amid his administration’s combative postures on issues of economic tariffs, drastic cuts to foreign aid and immigrant deportations, there is an enduring sense among many of his Christian supporters that Mr. Trump miraculously survived an assassination attempt last summer to remake America. Mr. Trump is not known to attend church regularly, and at times in the past he has sounded ignorant of Christian language and beliefs. But after the assassination attempt, Mr. Trump said he had been saved from death by “the grace of almighty God.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Some children were exposed to lead and investigators found flaking paint inside aging schools. Two federal experts, expected to help guide the response, have lost their jobs.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Some children were exposed to lead and investigators found flaking paint inside aging schools. Two federal experts, expected to help guide the response, have lost their jobs. By Julie Bosman Photographs and Video by Jamie Kelter Davis Reporting from Milwaukee Milwaukee is facing a deepening lead crisis in its schools, and it suddenly finds itself without help from the country’s top public health agency. Four children in the Milwaukee Public Schools have been found to be exposed to high levels of lead in the last six months. Investigators have discovered seven schools with flaking lead paint and lead dust inside classrooms and basements. Three school buildings have been shuttered so far, and officials said that more are expected to follow — as soon as next week — as the investigation expands. In the past, school districts have turned to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help manage lead problems. But weeks ago, the commissioner of the Milwaukee health department was told that a toxicologist and epidemiologist from the C.D.C., both lead experts who were expected to assist city officials with the local response, had been fired from the agency. Then the Milwaukee health department was dealt an even sharper blow: Its request for federal assistance from C.D.C. experts to help manage the lead crisis, known as an Epi-Aid, had been formally denied. “There is no bat phone anymore,” Dr. Michael Totoraitis, the Milwaukee health commissioner, said in an interview. “I can’t pick up and call my colleagues at the C.D.C. about lead poisoning anymore.” The C.D.C. is already reeling from layoffs targeting 2,400 employees, nearly one-fifth of its work force. The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the C.D.C., did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump administration has said that it is cutting positions throughout the federal government to reduce spending and bureaucratic bloat. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Since the post-Nixon era, the Internal Revenue Service has had a degree of independence from the White House. President Trump is seeking to change that.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by News Analysis Since the post-Nixon era, the Internal Revenue Service has had a degree of independence from the White House. President Trump is seeking to change that. By Andrew DuehrenAlan Rappeport and Russ Buettner Andrew Duehren and Alan Rappeport reported from Washington, and Russ Buettner from New York. In the years after President Richard Nixon enlisted the Internal Revenue Service to investigate his political opponents, Congress passed a series of laws to make sure the agency would focus on collecting taxes and not use its vast powers to carry out political vendettas. But President Trump has moved swiftly to suppress that independence in the first few months of his second term and, tax experts and former agency officials warn, return the I.R.S. to darker days when it was used as a political tool of the president. His administration has decimated the ranks of I.R.S. civil servants and moved to install political allies in their place. This week, he publicly called for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status, an extraordinary attempt to enlist the I.R.S. in his feud with the wealthy research university. In the Oval Office on Thursday, Mr. Trump renewed that threat and suggested that several other universities the administration has accused of antisemitism could also lose their tax-exempt status. “Tax-exempt status, it’s a privilege, it’s really a privilege and it’s been abused by a lot more than Harvard, so we’ll see how that all works out,” he said, also mentioning Columbia and Princeton. The I.R.S. is now weighing whether to revoke Harvard’s tax exemption, as The New York Times reported earlier this week. Federal law bars the president from ordering the I.R.S. to conduct specific tax investigations. A White House spokesman has said the agency’s scrutiny of Harvard began before the president’s social media post. Mr. Trump said Thursday that he did not believe the I.R.S. had “made a final ruling.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president said he would “always protect the Second Amendment.”",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president said he would “always protect the Second Amendment.” By Jonathan Wolfe President Trump said on Thursday that the shooting at Florida State University in Tallahassee that killed two people and injured six was a “shame,” but suggested that it would not prompt him to support any new gun control legislation. “These things are terrible, but the gun doesn’t do the shooting — the people do,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “It’s, you know, a phrase that’s used probably too often. I will tell you that it’s a shame.” His remarks came in response to a reporter who asked if he wanted to make any changes to the country’s gun laws in light of the shooting. Mr. Trump replied that he would “always protect the Second Amendment.” “As far as legislation is concerned, this has been going on for a long time,” he said. “I have an obligation to protect the Second Amendment. I ran on the Second Amendment.” Mr. Trump said that he was very familiar with the school and the area. The university is about 400 miles from Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s residence in Palm Beach. On Thursday, a 20-year-old student at the school shot and killed two people and injured six others, the police said. The gunman, Phoenix Ikner, is the son of a deputy in the local sheriff’s department, and was taken into custody after being shot by the police, officials said. While the shooting may not have changed Mr. Trump’s position on gun laws, his administration was already expected to roll back an array of gun control measures. The Justice Department also plans to create a path for people with criminal convictions to own guns again, and has threatened investigations of states it perceives to be violating Second Amendment rights. Since Mr. Trump took office, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is tasked with stemming the spread of illegal guns, has been weakened by staff departures and by the diversion of agents from core duties to immigration enforcement.

"The administration cast the threat by the judge, James E. Boasberg, to open criminal contempt proceedings as another salvo in an increasingly bitter battle between the White House and the courts.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The administration cast the threat by the judge, James E. Boasberg, to open criminal contempt proceedings as another salvo in an increasingly bitter battle between the White House and the courts. By Alan Feuer After attacking judges and repeatedly sidestepping their orders, the Trump administration has accused a federal judge in Washington of escalating tensions between the judicial and executive branches by seeking to hold the White House accountable for its courtroom behavior. The accusation against the judge, James E. Boasberg, came in a court filing early Friday morning by the Justice Department. In it, department lawyers asked the federal appeals court that sits over Judge Boasberg to prevent him from opening an expansive contempt inquiry into whether the White House violated an order he issued in March to stop flights of Venezuelan migrants from being sent to El Salvador under the authority of a powerful wartime statute. Much of the filing to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia read like a normal legal brief, laying out the government’s challenge to a judicial order it did not like. But in its opening line, department lawyers made clear that they believed Judge Boasberg’s recent threat to open criminal contempt proceedings in the deportation case represented another salvo in an increasingly bitter battle between the White House and the courts. “‘Occasions for constitutional confrontation between the two branches should be avoided whenever possible,’” the department lawyers wrote, failing to mention their own role in fostering such confrontations. “The district court’s criminal contempt order instead escalates the constitutional stakes by infringing core executive prerogatives.” The Justice Department’s attempt to blame Judge Boasberg for raising the temperature came as another federal judge, in another deportation case, has opened her own high-stakes inquiry into whether the administration has violated court orders. In that case, Judge Paula Xinis announced on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Maryland that the administration in the next two weeks would have to answer questions about why it had so far apparently failed to comply with directions from the Supreme Court to “facilitate” the release of a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, from the same Salvadoran prison to which the Venezuelan migrants had been sent.

"America’s adversaries have more room to operate, at least in the disinformation space, cybersecurity experts say.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by America’s adversaries have more room to operate, at least in the disinformation space, cybersecurity experts say. By Helene Cooper and Julian E. Barnes Reporting from Washington This month, a network of pro-Russian websites began a campaign aimed at undermining confidence in the U.S. defense industry, according to disinformation analysts. The F-35 fighter jet was one target. The effort, coordinated by a Russian group known as Portal Kombat, spread rumors that American allies purchasing the warplanes would not have complete control over them, the analysts said. In the past, U.S. cybersecurity agencies would counter such campaigns by calling them out to raise public awareness. The F.B.I. would warn social media companies of inauthentic accounts so they could be removed. And, at times, U.S. Cyber Command would try to take Russian troll farms that create disinformation offline, at least temporarily. But President Trump has fired General Timothy D. Haugh, a four-star general with years of experience countering Russian online propaganda, from his posts leading U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency. The F.B.I. has shut down its foreign influence task force. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has ended its efforts to expose disinformation. And this week the State Department put employees who tracked global disinformation on leave, shutting down the effort that had publicized the spread of Chinese and Russian propaganda. Almost three months into Mr. Trump’s second term, the guardrails intended to prevent national security missteps have come down as the new team races to anticipate and amplify the wishes of an unpredictable president. The result has been a diminished role for national security expertise, even in the most consequential foreign policy decisions. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Tony Evers, a Democrat, used his veto power to increase school funding limits for four centuries longer than Republican lawmakers in the state had intended. By Mitch Smith  The sentence, dull but clear, was buried 158 pages into Wisconsin’s budget. “For the limit for the 2023-24 school year and the 2024-25 school year,” the sentence read when it was passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature, “add $325” to the amount school districts could generate through property taxes for each student. But by the time Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, and his veto pen were finished, it said something else entirely: “For the limit for 2023-2425, add $325.” It was clever. Creative. Perhaps even a bit subversive, extending the increase four centuries longer than lawmakers intended. But was it legal? On Friday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court said yes. In a 4-to-3 ruling in a lawsuit challenging Mr. Evers’s use of his partial veto authority, the court’s liberal majority said the governor had acted legally. The three conservative justices on the court dissented. “We uphold the 2023 partial vetoes, and in doing so we are acutely aware that a 400-year modification is both significant and attention-grabbing,” Justice Jill J. Karofsky wrote in the majority opinion. “However, our Constitution does not limit the governor’s partial veto power based on how much or how little the partial vetoes change policy, even when that change is considerable.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The power outage, which began on Wednesday, was the latest to hit the island, which has long suffered from blackouts.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The power outage, which began on Wednesday, was the latest to hit the island, which has long suffered from blackouts. By Jenny Gross Almost all power has been restored in Puerto Rico, two days after a blackout left the entire island without electricity. As of 10 a.m. on Friday, 99 percent of the 1.4 million customers had electricity, according to Luma Energy, the private contractor that operates the island’s power transmission system. The blackout began Wednesday afternoon, and on Thursday afternoon 40 percent of customers were still without power. This week’s power failure, which caused hundreds of businesses to close and forced the airport in San Juan, the capital, to run on generators, was only the latest blackout for Puerto Rico, whose residents have endured years of unreliable electricity service. Puerto Rico’s power grid has been plagued by extensive problems since Hurricane Maria hit the island in 2017, leaving many without power for months. Lorenzo Lopez, a spokesman for Luma Energy, a Canadian and American company based in San Juan, said the blackout followed a fault on the transmission line. A number of factors had contributed to the problem, including that the power transmission system is fragile, hard to stabilize and outdated, he said. Luma, which began operating in Puerto Rico in 2021, is still investigating the full cause of the issue, he said. Puerto Rico’s power system has suffered from years of mismanagement and poor maintenance. The island experienced a major blackout on New Year’s Eve, when most of Puerto Rico was darkened by a power outage, leading to calls for the government to cancel contracts with the companies that oversee the transmission, distribution and generation of power on the island. “When are we going to do something?” Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican reggaeton superstar, wrote on X on Wednesday. Officials warned in March that the system was not likely to have enough supply to meet peak demand over the summer. Jenny Gross is a reporter for The Times covering breaking news and other topics.

Harvard disputed the claim.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Stepping up its pressure campaign, the Education Department accused the university of failing to report large foreign gifts as required by law. Harvard disputed the claim. By Karoun Demirjian Reporting from Washington The Trump administration on Thursday accused Harvard University of failing to report large foreign donations to the federal government as required by law, part of a widening effort to target the institution after it refused to comply with President Trump’s demands. In a letter to Alan M. Garber, the university’s president, the Education Department told Harvard to provide names of foreign donors and all records of communication with them from the beginning of 2020. The department also asked for a swath of records pertaining to foreigners who had spent time at Harvard, including any students Harvard had expelled or those who had their credentials canceled, going back to 2016. The request included details on visiting researchers, scholars, students and faculty from other countries beginning from 2010, along with their last known addresses. Jason Newton, a Harvard spokesman, disputed the notion that the university had not been complying with laws requiring them to file reports disclosing foreign donations of more than $250,000. “Harvard has filed Section 117 reports for decades as part of its ongoing compliance with the law,” he said in a statement. The records request is the latest instance of the Trump administration’s efforts to pressure Harvard into submission as it cracks down on a number of institutions of higher learning over diversity and equity initiatives and what it called a failure to address antisemitism on campuses.

"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent complained to President Trump that the acting commissioner had been installed without his knowledge.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent complained to President Trump that the acting commissioner had been installed without his knowledge. By Jonathan SwanAndrew DuehrenAlan Rappeport and Maggie Haberman Reporting from Washington President Trump has replaced the acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service after his appointment just days earlier set off a power struggle between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the billionaire Elon Musk, five people with knowledge of the change said Friday. Mr. Bessent’s deputy, Michael Faulkender, will be the new acting leader, replacing Gary Shapley, the Treasury Department confirmed on Friday. Mr. Faulkender will be the third acting leader of the agency this week. Mr. Bessent had complained to Mr. Trump this week that Mr. Musk had done an end run around him to get Mr. Shapley installed as the interim head of the I.R.S., even though the tax collection agency reports to Mr. Bessent, the people familiar with the situation said. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. The clash was the latest instance of Mr. Musk’s influence in the Trump administration that has alarmed top officials. It was also the latest upheaval at the tax agency, with much of its staff pushed out or quitting. Mr. Trump earlier this week called for the I.R.S. to revoke Harvard University’s tax-exempt status after the school refused to impose sweeping changes demanded by the administration. An I.R.S. spokeswoman declined to comment on the leadership changes. Mr. Shapley, a longtime I.R.S. agent, gained fame among conservatives after he claimed that the Justice Department had slow-walked its investigation into Hunter Biden’s taxes. Mr. Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency pushed Mr. Shapley’s appointment through White House channels, but Mr. Bessent was not consulted or asked for his blessing, according to those with knowledge of the dynamic. Mr. Bessent then got Mr. Trump’s approval to unwind the decision within days, they said. Mr. Shapley had been working from the I.R.S. commissioner’s office as late as Friday morning.

"The Elon Musk operatives were abruptly shifted to the department’s immigration enforcement unit as part of an expanding effort to use personal data in deportation cases, one official said.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Elon Musk operatives were abruptly shifted to the department’s immigration enforcement unit as part of an expanding effort to use personal data in deportation cases, one official said. By Glenn Thrush Reporting from Washington Two top operatives with Elon Musk’s cost-cutting initiative have been transferred from the Social Security Administration to the Justice Department’s immigration enforcement unit as part of a widening White House effort to use personal data to target undocumented immigrants, according to officials briefed on the move. The operatives, Jon Koval and Payton Rehling, have been working on an embedded team from the Department of Government Efficiency that has tried to gain access to highly sensitive Social Security data with the purported goal of reducing government waste. So far, that effort has fallen short of its cost-cutting predictions. Mr. Koval, a 2020 business school graduate, and Mr. Rehling, a computer and machine learning specialist, will be responsible for scouring Social Security databases for information on thousands of undocumented immigrants already subject to deportation proceedings, according to a senior administration official with knowledge of their assignments. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The department has been given a vastly expanded role in immigration enforcement under President Trump. He has ordered federal prosecutors to prioritize criminal violations related to immigration, investigate local governments that obstruct enforcement and expel migrants by revoking their Social Security cards after falsely listing thousands of them as dead in databases. An internal memo outlining Mr. Koval’s temporary, 120-day transfer to the Justice Department was drafted on Tuesday, the same day that Mr. Trump issued an executive memo blocking migrants from obtaining Social Security benefits and directing the department to redeploy prosecutors in 50 U.S. attorneys’ offices to bring criminal cases and initiate deportations. The memo, obtained by The New York Times, described broad, and unspecified, authority in “reducing the immigration case backlog,” and said Mr. Koval would continue to work on projects “related” to Social Security.

It is unclear if his personal holdings had any bearing on his decisions regarding tariffs.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by As of August, the president’s investment portfolio showed significantly more in bonds than in stocks. It is unclear if his personal holdings had any bearing on his decisions regarding tariffs. By Ben ProtessAndrea Fuller and Joe Rennison The reporters analyzed more than 4,200 of President Trump’s investment holdings to assess his exposure to moves in the financial markets. When President Trump paused a punishing round of global tariffs last week, he attributed his change of heart to one main thing. “I was watching the bond market,” he said. “The bond market is very tricky.” Mr. Trump should know — he had a big personal stake in it. A New York Times analysis of Mr. Trump’s financial holdings shows that he had roughly $125 million to about $443 million invested in bonds as of last year, a range that far eclipsed his investment portfolio’s exposure to the stock market. Mr. Trump does own a huge stake in his publicly traded social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group, but he has said he has no plans to sell those shares, currently worth roughly $2 billion. The company’s stock, which he listed separately from his liquid stock and bond holdings on his latest financial disclosure, had already plunged about 40 percent this year before the new round of tariffs. Mr. Trump appeared unfazed when the tariffs sent the stock market into a tailspin, wiping out trillions of dollars in value in a matter of days. His nonchalance faded on April 9 after fears over the impact of Mr. Trump’s tariffs had spread to the government bond market, posing a potential existential threat to the global economy and signaling a weakening faith in U.S.-backed assets as a safe haven. Mr. Trump, whose own bond investments were also at risk, paused the most punitive of the import taxes for 90 days for all countries except China. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"President Trump says he wants Xi Jinping, China’s leader, to call him to talk tariffs. Mr. Xi is ghosting Mr. Trump, and markets are plummeting.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by News Analysis President Trump says he wants Xi Jinping, China’s leader, to call him to talk tariffs. Mr. Xi is ghosting Mr. Trump, and markets are plummeting. By Edward Wong Edward Wong is a diplomatic correspondent and former Beijing bureau chief who has written a new book on China. The global economy hinges on a phone call that hasn’t even been scheduled. As the Trump administration escalates its trade war, and as China retaliates, the American president and his aides say they are expecting Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, to call. “I have great respect for President Xi,” Mr. Trump said at a cabinet meeting last week. “He’s been a friend of mine for a long period of time, and I think that we’ll end up working out something that’s very good for both countries.” But Mr. Xi is ghosting Mr. Trump. He has flown instead to Southeast Asia this week to meet with leaders there to try to persuade them to stand with China in the trade war. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman earlier this month posted a video of Mao Zedong speaking in 1953, during the Korean War, in which China fought the United States: “No matter how long this war is going to last, we will never yield. We’ll fight until we completely triumph.” A bromance with Mr. Xi that Mr. Trump has desired for years is slipping out of his reach. With that goes a quick resolution to Mr. Trump’s trade war, tipping the American economy closer to a recession and vaporizing trillions of dollars from the U.S. stock market since he took office on Jan. 20. The trade conflict also threatens to inflame military and diplomatic tensions between the two superpowers. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The judge, a conservative Reagan appointee, wrote a blistering opinion accusing the administration of failing to give a man wrongly deported to El Salvador any semblance of due process.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The judge, a conservative Reagan appointee, wrote a blistering opinion accusing the administration of failing to give a man wrongly deported to El Salvador any semblance of due process. By Alan Feuer and Adam Liptak When a federal appeals court in Virginia pressed the White House in an order this week to take a more active approach in seeking the release of a Maryland man who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador last month, it caused a stir that was felt well beyond traditional legal circles. The attention was due in part to the order’s blistering language in accusing the Trump administration of failing to give the deported man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, any semblance of due process and to its elegiac tone about the state of American democracy. But an uproar also ensued because of who wrote the opinion: Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, a conservative Reagan appointee who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Judge Wilkinson, 80, has emerged in recent weeks as a scathing critic of the White House’s handling of the case of Mr. Abrego Garcia, who several Trump officials have acknowledged was deported to El Salvador in violation of a court order expressly barring him from being sent there. Judge Wilkinson has voiced his outrage at the White House’s mistake, writing in an opinion two weeks ago, “There is no question that the government screwed up here.” He has shown even less patience for the administration’s refusal to do much to get Mr. Abrego Garcia back from a notoriously dangerous Salvadoran prison.

By Victor Mather The quicksand depicted in films, when a daring adventurer is suddenly ensnared in a life-threatening vortex of sand, is largely a myth. But that didn’t make it any less scary when Mitchell O’Brien slowly began to sink. Mr. O’Brien was on Van’s Beach on the northeastern shore of Lake Michigan with his friend Breanne Sika last weekend hunting for Leland bluestones, a byproduct of the iron ore furnaces that operated in the nearby fishing village that attract rock hunters. Some dredging had been taking place on the beach, and Mr. O’Brien, 37, from Traverse City, Mich., said he had thought the sand felt unstable. “‘That looks really dangerous,’” he recalled Ms. Sika saying. “I turned around and ended up walking right to the spot she said was dangerous. “I got my one foot stuck because I was trying to get my electronics out of my pocket. I knew not to panic. I have to be a macho man. You can’t ask for help when you’re trying to impress the girl you’re with.” Soon enough, Mr. O’Brien was waist-deep in the sand.

"The judge said that he needed more time to determine whether the new policy was discriminatory, but said that the elimination of rotating access for newswires was “facially neutral.”",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The judge said that he needed more time to determine whether the new policy was discriminatory, but said that the elimination of rotating access for newswires was “facially neutral.” By Minho Kim Reporting from Washington A federal judge in Washington on Friday denied a request from The Associated Press to enforce his order requiring the White House to restore the outlet’s full access to President Trump. Lawyers for The A.P. had accused the White House of defying the order, at first by continuing to bar its journalists from presidential events, then by issuing a policy eliminating the regular, permanent spot in the press pool shared by three independent newswires. Even though A.P. journalists had been allowed into some events in recent days, the lawyers said, their access had not been equal to that of reporters from Reuters, one of the other newswires. The press pool is a small, rotating group of journalists who cover smaller events at the White House and press briefings on Air Force One, as they follow the president on trips in and outside of Washington. The new policy puts the newswires into a larger group of print media outlets that includes The New York Times — effectively reducing The A.P.’s access. The judge who ruled on Friday, Trevor N. McFadden of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, said that he needed more time to determine whether the new policy was discriminatory. For now, he said, Mr. Trump and the White House could be seen as acting in “good faith” to comply with his order, with the new policy being “facially neutral.” But he added that he would consider it problematic if the policy resulted in “viewpoint discrimination.” Last week, Judge McFadden found that the Trump administration had violated the First Amendment by excluding The A.P. from the press pool since February, after the news organization said that it would continue to use the term “Gulf of Mexico” to refer to the body of water that Mr. Trump renamed the Gulf of America. The Associated Press is considered one of the world’s leading newswires, distributing articles, photographs and videos to thousands of U.S. news outlets, as well as 900 international sites. During a hearing on Friday, Judge McFadden appeared skeptical that the new policy was not intended to continue excluding The A.P. in defiance of his order. He warned the government of “consequences” if evidence emerged that the White House was not complying with his order. “That would be a way more serious problem,” he said. “There could be consequences.” At one point, he raised his voice with a government lawyer, Jane M. Lyons, after she cut him off mid-sentence. He grilled Ms. Lyons over how he could ensure compliance from the government, and asked when he would know whether the Trump administration was defying his order. “It’s very hard to see how there is compliance when records show that nothing changed for three days,” Judge McFadden said, referring to records from the past few days, when A.P. journalists were excluded from participating in the White House pool. He added: “I don’t have many experiences with parties violating my injunction.” Zach Montague contributed reporting. Minho Kim covers breaking news and climate change for The Times.

Along the way we spoke to many Americans who felt a sense of wonder about that April night. By Jenna Russell Photographs by Todd Heisler Jenna Russell and Todd Heisler reported from Massachusetts, where they spent two days fighting Boston traffic while driving Revere’s route. Of all the moonlit nights in American history, one in particular has gripped the public imagination. On April 18, 1775, a 40-year-old Boston silversmith named Paul Revere borrowed a horse and sped west to warn his fellow colonists. A looming threat had spurred his urgent errand. The British were coming. Exactly 250 years later, Revere’s midnight ride still resonates for many along his 16-mile route — a symbol of enduring American values, and a reminder of the heavy costs the country’s founders were willing to pay in pursuit of freedom and autonomy. “It can’t be overstated, the risk that he was taking,” said Nikki Stewart, director of Old North Illuminated, the nonprofit that oversees historic Old North Church in Boston. “To leave the comfort and safety of his home, his wife and seven children, in the middle of the night — it’s a profound level of conviction.” Hancock-Clarke House Area of detail Mass.

"The head of the division directed its staff to focus on enforcing edicts on transgender women in sports and other issues, shifting from its founding purpose of fighting race-based discrimination.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The head of the division directed its staff to focus on enforcing edicts on transgender women in sports and other issues, shifting from its founding purpose of fighting race-based discrimination. By Glenn Thrush Reporting from Washington The head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division has rewritten a mission statement to prioritize enforcement of President Trump’s culture war edicts, including participation of transgender women in sports, in a sharp break from its founding purpose of fighting race-based discrimination. In an email, Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative activist close to the White House who leads the unit, directed the division’s career work force to pursue the president’s agenda, outlined in executive orders and presidential memorandums, or face unspecified consequences. The revised statement encouraged investigations into antisemitism, anti-Christian bias and noncompliance with a range of Trump executive fiats. “The zealous and faithful pursuit of this section’s mission requires the full dedication of this section’s resources, attention and energy to the priorities of the president,” Ms. Dhillon wrote. The memo, obtained by The New York Times, was addressed to the division’s enforcement arm responsible for prohibiting discrimination by recipients of federal funds — nearly every local government entity in the country. In a separate mission statement sent to the division’s voting rights unit, Ms. Dhillon directed department lawyers to root out voter fraud and prosecute undocumented immigrants who tried to vote in U.S. elections. Both are rare events, despite efforts by Trump Republicans, including Ms. Dhillon, to portray them as a major threat to election integrity. A Justice Department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. She did not explicitly say she would not open investigations into racial discrimination, but Ms. Dhillon and the interim leadership that preceded her arrival this month have already moved to reverse a handful of high-profile Biden-era actions. Last week, she nullified a 2022 agreement with an impoverished Alabama county intended to address troubling disparities in the quality of drinking water, infrastructure to protect residents from flooding and sewer systems for Black and white residents.

You could see the rest of the traffic was allowed to go by. We were pulled over by soldiers and told that we were not allowed to proceed any farther. Much later in the afternoon, I was actually getting ready to catch a plane out of San Salvador back here later yesterday evening, and all of a sudden I got word that I would be allowed to meet with Kilmar Abrego Garcia. And they brought him to the hotel where I was staying. He spoke several times about your 5-year-old son who has autism. Five-year-old son, who was in the car in Maryland when Kilmar was pulled over by U.S. government agents and handcuffed. His 5-year-old son was in the car at that time. He told me that he was taken to Baltimore first. I assume that was the Baltimore detention center. He asked to make a phone call from there to let people know what had happened to him. But he was denied that opportunity. By Robert Jimison Robert Jimison, who traveled to El Salvador to accompany Senator Chris Van Hollen, reported from Dulles International Airport. Senator Chris Van Hollen said on Friday that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration, reported having been traumatized inside a maximum-security prison in El Salvador before being transferred to another detention facility, where he remains in isolation. The Maryland Democrat, who traveled to El Salvador to press for Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release and ended up meeting with him in San Salvador, said that Mr. Abrego Garcia had been transferred nine days ago from the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, to a lower-level facility in Santa Ana. “He said that the conditions were better at this new detention center, but he was still in a total blackout,” Mr. Van Hollen said in an interview before arriving back in Washington. “No news from the outside world. Can’t speak to anybody at all.” At a news conference at Dulles International Airport after returning, Mr. Van Hollen said that Mr. Abrego Garcia had told him that during his nearly three weeks at the maximum-security prison, “he was not afraid of the other prisoners in his immediate cell, but that he was traumatized by being at CECOT and fearful of many of the prisoners in other cell blocks who called out to him and taunted him in various ways.” During their meeting Thursday evening, Mr. Abrego Garcia shared details with Mr. Van Hollen about his initial arrest and his time at CECOT, which El Salvador’s government says holds some of the most dangerous criminal gang members. Mr. Abrego Garcia described having been detained and taken to Baltimore, where he had asked to make a phone call but had been denied. He was then taken to a detention facility in Texas before being handcuffed and shackled, put on a plane with blacked-out windows with other deportees and eventually deposited at CECOT.

"President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio both suggested Friday that the United States might wash its hands of the peace effort.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Russia-Ukraine War Advertisement Supported by News Analysis President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio both suggested Friday that the United States might wash its hands of the peace effort. By David E. Sanger David E. Sanger has covered six presidencies and frequently writes about the revival of superpower conflict, the subject of his latest book. “If it is not possible to end the war in Ukraine, we need to move on.” Those were the stark words of Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday, as he prepared to leave a conference of allies in Paris, warning that the cease-fire deal that President Trump repeatedly vowed he would secure in “24 hours” may not prove attainable after all. Mr. Rubio’s threat raised urgent questions about how the United States would navigate the largely stalled negotiations with Russia — and about what would happen if they collapse. Do Mr. Rubio and Mr. Trump simply wash their hands of the peace effort, and walk away? The option was implicit in Mr. Rubio’s warning that “it’s not our war,” followed by the reminder that “we have other priorities to focus on.” Or are they actually washing their hands of Ukraine itself? That message was implicit in Mr. Trump’s confrontation with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office in February, when he and Vice President JD Vance made it clear to the world that the three-year wartime partnership between Washington and Kyiv was shattered. That meeting ended, famously, with Mr. Zelensky being expelled from the White House, enormously pleasing one man: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Whatever Mr. Rubio’s meaning, his words were the latest American gift to Mr. Putin’s cause. At every turn since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, he or his top national security aides have issued statements that played to Russia’s advantage: taking NATO membership for Ukraine off the table, repeatedly declaring that Ukraine would have to give up territory and even blaming Ukraine for the invasion itself.

Fiscal year numbers, adjusted for inflation. Numbers after 2009 include research and development funding for non-scientific fields, which represents a small amount of the total. By Jeremy W. Peters and Andrea Fuller For over eight decades, American universities and the federal government wound themselves into an ever tighter embrace. The United States wanted to build the most powerful bombs and cure the worst diseases. It wanted to be first to explore the outer edges of the solar system. It wanted to grow more efficient crops. And so, it offered millions, and then billions, to researchers at universities across the country — in Cambridge, Mass., and Berkeley, Calif., but also in Minnesota, Indiana and Mississippi. The schools took the money. They built the best labs and attracted top-notch professors and students from around the world. They also became increasingly and, at first, somewhat warily beholden to the whims of politicians in Washington. Now, this mutually beneficial bargain has started to unravel. President Trump and many Republicans say they will use the threat of deep funding cuts to rein in out-of-control progressive activism on campus, which they believe has driven universities away from their mission to educate and mold better citizens. With confidence in higher education waning among Americans, the president also believes he has public opinion on his side. But as the Trump administration starts cutting — including an announcement it would pull $2.2 billion in multiyear grants from Harvard University this week — the future of the partnership that built the American research university into the world’s engine of scientific innovation is anything but certain. American universities spent $60 billion in federal money on research and development in fiscal year 2023 alone. That’s more than 30 times as much as what they spent in the early 1950s, adjusted for inflation, when the research university system was just beginning to grow into the vast industry it is today.

By Alan FeuerHamed Aleaziz and Abbie VanSickle The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Trump administration early Saturday from deporting another group of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members under the expansive powers of a rarely invoked wartime law. “The government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this court,” the court said in a brief, unsigned order that gave no reasoning, as is typical in emergency cases. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. dissented, with Justice Alito saying he would issue a statement later. Late Saturday, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to “dissolve” the temporary block and allow lower courts to weigh in on the matter before intervening further in the case. More than 50 Venezuelans were scheduled to be flown out of the country — presumably to El Salvador — from an immigration detention center in Anson, Texas, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The American Civil Liberties Union in recent days had already secured court orders barring similar deportations under the law, the Alien Enemies Act, in other places including New York, Denver and Brownsville, Texas.

"The case is one of several challenging moves by the Trump administration to cancel the temporary legal status of hundreds of thousands of people.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The case is one of several challenging moves by the Trump administration to cancel the temporary legal status of hundreds of thousands of people. By Jazmine Ulloa Reporting from Washington A federal appeals court on Friday reaffirmed temporary legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants the Trump administration wanted to immediately deport, rejecting an emergency request from the White House. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco declined to reverse a lower-court judge's ruling on March 31 that blocked efforts by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, to terminate the protections for Venezuelans known as Temporary Protected Status. A three-judge panel said the government had not demonstrated it would “suffer irreparable harm” should that ruling stand. The case is one of several challenging the moves by the Trump administration to end deportation protections for hundreds of thousands of people from two countries, Venezuela and Haiti. Venezuelans have made up the largest group of T.P.S. holders in the United States — now as many as 700,000 people — as repression and economic devastation under Venezuela’s autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro, have prompted millions of people to flee the nation in recent years. The court decision on Friday preserved the T.P.S. status of about 350,000 people who lost their deportation protections on April 7. Hundreds of thousands of more people were expected to lose the status later this year. Lawyers representing Venezuelan T.P.S. holders and the National TPS Alliance, an immigrant advocacy organization, have asked the courts to keep Ms. Noem’s actions from going into effect while they challenge the Trump administration’s attempts to revoke the form of legal status. They argue that the secretary has violated administrative procedures and acted with racial bias in attempting to revoke extensions of the protections, which were offered to migrants under the Biden administration. Lawyers from the Justice Department, which is representing Ms. Noem and her agency, argued that Trump administration officials have acted solely on the basis of national security and concern for public safety. They contended that the lower court ruling intruded on Ms. Noem’s authority to make agency decisions. The Temporary Protected Status program, passed by Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, allows people from certain troubled nations like Haiti and Ukraine to live and work legally in the country. In a statement late Friday, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, argued that the T.P.S. program had long been abused. “While this ruling delays justice and undermines the integrity of our immigration system, Secretary Noem will use every legal option at the Department’s disposal to end this chaos, prioritizing the safety of Americans,” she said. Lawyers and immigrant rights advocates on Friday said that the preservation of the T.P.S. program for Venezuelan families was critical at a time when the Trump administration sought to aggressively expand deportations. “This decision reaffirms what our communities have always known — that our lives are not bargaining chips and our presence here is rooted in justice,” said Jose Palma, the coordinator for the National TPS Alliance.

"Cedric Lodge stole organs from cadavers that had been donated for medical research, prosecutors said. The university fired him in 2023.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Cedric Lodge stole organs from cadavers that had been donated for medical research, prosecutors said. The university fired him in 2023. By Neil Vigdor A former manager of the morgue at Harvard Medical School will plead guilty to stealing body parts that had been donated for research and selling them for thousands of dollars to people who collected them as macabre curiosities, according to court documents. The supervisor, Cedric Lodge, 57, who was fired by the university in 2023, had been entrusted with handling cadavers that were part of the medical school’s Anatomical Gift Program and were supposed to be cremated after the research on them had been completed, prosecutors said. But according to a sweeping federal investigation, Mr. Lodge turned the morgue into a shopping emporium for brains, skin and other body parts, supplying them to collectors in several states as part of a criminal network that involved several people, including his wife. Investigators said he drove the stolen body parts to his home in New Hampshire. The breach went undetected from about 2018 until March 2023, tainting one of the nation’s most prestigious medical schools. In a filing on Wednesday in federal court in Pennsylvania, Mr. Lodge agreed that he would plead guilty to one count of interstate transportation of stolen goods, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. Under the plea deal, he will no longer face a conspiracy charge. Prosecutors recommended that he receive less than the maximum sentence, but a judge will make the final decision. In a statement on Friday, Dr. George Q. Daley, the dean of Harvard Medical School, condemned Mr. Lodge’s misconduct. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"A series of setbacks have raised questions about Elon Musk’s enduring influence in the White House.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","U.S.A.I.D. Advertisement Newsletter A series of setbacks have raised questions about Elon Musk’s enduring influence in the White House. By Jess Bidgood At the start of the new Trump administration, Elon Musk’s influence seemed to have no limits. He was in the Oval Office, one of his sons on his shoulders. He was meeting with heads of state. He was putting the United States Agency for International Development through the “wood chipper.” He gave a Fox News interview with President Trump. Over the past couple of weeks, though, Trump’s highest-profile governing partner has faced setbacks that raise questions about his enduring power and relationships in the White House. Some of my colleagues reported today that the acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service was being replaced after the Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, complained that Musk had his preferred candidate installed in the role without Bessent’s blessing. It was only on Tuesday that Trump had appointed Musk’s choice, Gary Shapley, to run the agency temporarily. But since then, my colleagues reported, Bessent secured the president’s approval to send Musk’s pick packing. It’s the latest bump in the road during Musk’s three-month crash course in government. He has repeatedly rankled certain members of Trump’s cabinet by failing to coordinate with them. His overall progress with the Department of Government Efficiency has been slower than he imagined. He was practically admonished by Trump in public after a plan for him to receive a classified briefing on China was leaked and then scuttled. He suffered a high-profile political defeat after inserting himself into this month’s Wisconsin Supreme Court race. And despite his public opposition to Trump’s tariffs — and the trade adviser promoting them — he is not believed to have played a substantial role in persuading the president to change course.

"His biological mother said in an interview on Friday that she was bewildered by the attack, and had been against the presence of firearms in her son’s life.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Florida State University Shooting Advertisement Supported by His biological mother said in an interview on Friday that she was bewildered by the attack, and had been against the presence of firearms in her son’s life. By Patricia MazzeiAndrew PantaziKate Selig and Christina Morales Patricia Mazzei reported from Miami; Andrew Pantazi from Tallahassee, Fla.; and Kate Selig and Christina Morales from New York. The 20-year-old student accused of killing two people and wounding six others at Florida State University had expressed extremist political views that made classmates uncomfortable, talked about his interest in guns and experienced years of family tumult that culminated in his changing his name in high school. The day after the shooting terrorized Florida State students, forcing them to flee or hide from gunfire at the university’s campus in Tallahassee, interviews and extensive court records offered an early portrait of the suspect, though law enforcement officials remained silent on what might have motivated the attack. By the time the suspect, Phoenix Ikner, was 6 years old, court records showed that he had to repeat kindergarten. His parents fought bitterly over every aspect of his care while accusing each other of manipulation and abuse. Judges were forced to intervene again and again as the parents traded allegations of domestic violence and stalking. The legal battle consumed nearly his entire childhood and ended only when he became an adult and most of the family court matters became moot. “All I wanted for him was a loving environment,” his biological mother, Anne-Mari Eriksen, said on Friday in a brief interview, in which she was clearly upset. “I was always concerned about his mental health and happiness.” She said she remained bewildered by the shooting and had been against the presence of firearms in her son’s life. “I feel bad for the people at F.S.U.,” she said. “My heart goes out to them. My heart is also with my son.” Chief Lawrence E. Revell of the Tallahassee Police Department said in a video statement that the suspect, a Florida State student, appeared to have no direct connection to his victims. The chief added that the suspect would face charges up to and including first-degree murder. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"The legal underpinnings of the administration’s broadsides against universities and schools stretch precedents and cut corners.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by The legal underpinnings of the administration’s broadsides against universities and schools stretch precedents and cut corners. By Jonah E. BromwichAlan Blinder and Sarah Mervosh In the White House’s campaign against Harvard University, the punishment came swiftly. The Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in grants to the school, while seeking to exert unprecedented control over hiring, impose unspecified reforms to its medical and divinity schools, block certain foreign students from enrolling and, potentially, revoke its tax-exempt status. It is a broadside with little precedent. And, as with the White House’s other attacks on universities, colleges and even K-12 schools, the legal justifications have been muddled, stretched and, in some instances, impossible to determine. “It’s punishment before a trial, punishment before evidence, punishment before an actual accusation that could be responded to,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education and the U.S. Department of Education’s third-ranking official during the Obama administration. “People talk about why higher ed hasn’t responded. Well, how can you fight a shadow in this way?​” The legality of each threat varies. In more typical times, some of the individual punishments might be validated by lengthy investigations in which a university would have a right to defend itself. But taken together, law professors and education experts said, the immediacy of the sanctions and threats conveyed an unmistakable hostility toward Harvard and other schools in the president’s sights. The broad vendetta, they said, could weaken the legal argument for each individual action. “You can’t make decisions — even if you have the power to do so — on the basis of animus,” said Brian Galle, a Georgetown University law professor who teaches about taxation policy and nonprofit organizations. “Those aren’t permissible reasons that the government can act. And so what’s interesting about the fact that it’s doing all of these things to Harvard at the same time, is that undermines the legitimacy of each of them individually.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The court barred the Trump administration from laying off nearly 1,500 workers at the agency until at least April 28.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The court barred the Trump administration from laying off nearly 1,500 workers at the agency until at least April 28. By Stacy Cowley One day after the Trump administration sent layoff notices to the vast majority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s workers, a federal judge temporarily blocked the action and ordered a hearing to determine whether the attempted mass firing violated an injunction she imposed last month. In a brief court session Friday morning, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the Federal District Court in Washington pressed Justice Department lawyers for details about layoff notices sent Thursday to nearly 1,500 of the consumer bureau’s 1,700 workers. The messages told workers that they would lose access to their email accounts and work systems on Friday evening. Judge Jackson issued an oral order, followed by a written one, barring the government from carrying out that plan until at least April 28, when she plans to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue. Her ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the consumer bureau’s staff union and other parties. “Once again, the court is confronted with evidence that gives rise to concerns that there will be no agency standing by the time it gets to consider the merits,” she said in her written order. Russell T. Vought, director of the White House budget office, became the consumer bureau’s acting director in early February and immediately began dismantling the agency — which cannot be closed without congressional action. Judge Jackson issued an injunction last month freezing those actions, saying that she wanted to make sure the agency existed long enough for courts to evaluate whether Mr. Vought’s actions were lawful. One week ago, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit pared back Judge Jackson’s order and said Trump officials could fire workers whom they decided — after a “particularized assessment” — were not needed to fulfill the agency’s legally mandated responsibilities.

"A group of transgender plaintiffs sued President Trump and the State Department over a new rule prohibiting passports from including a gender different from the sex listed on an original birth certificate.",2025-04-18,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by A group of transgender plaintiffs sued President Trump and the State Department over a new rule prohibiting passports from including a gender different from the sex listed on an original birth certificate. By Amy Harmon and Maya Shwayder A federal judge in Boston on Friday ordered the Trump administration to issue passports that reflect the self-identified gender of six transgender people rather than requiring that the passports display the sex on the applicants’ original birth certificates. The order from Judge Julia E. Kobick was a victory, at least temporarily, for the six plaintiffs, who she said were likely to prevail on their claim that a new policy by the Trump administration amounts to a form of unconstitutional sex discrimination under the Fifth Amendment, as well as the Administrative Procedures Act. The State Department adopted the new policy earlier this year to comply with an executive order from President Trump directing all government agencies to limit official recognition of transgender identity. “The plaintiffs have been personally disadvantaged by the government — they can no longer obtain a passport consistent with their gender identity — because of their sex assigned at birth,” wrote Judge Kobick, who was nominated by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “The passport policy does indeed impose a special disadvantage on the plaintiffs due to their sex and the court therefore concludes that it discriminates on the basis of sex.” The judge’s order on Friday applied only to six transgender plaintiffs who were seeking new passports and had sued the Trump administration. The order does not apply to a seventh plaintiff, who already holds a passport, valid until 2028, with the sex marker that corresponds to his gender identity. The order, which will remain in place as the case goes forward, does not bar the government from the new passport requirement for other transgender people. In court documents, the plaintiffs suing the government argued that a mismatch between the sex listed on their passport and the way they think of themselves and are perceived puts them at risk of suspicion and hostility that other Americans do not face. During the first several weeks of Mr. Trump’s administration, two plaintiffs received passports with an “F” or “M” marker that was contrary to what they had requested. Another plaintiff learned that selecting an “X” marker, indicating a nonbinary gender identity, was no longer an option in the application process, though it had been allowed since 2022. The restrictions on passports are part of a broad effort by the Trump administration to minimize the role of gender identity in how American society organizes itself. In the first of a series of executive orders on transgender issues, Mr. Trump characterized people whose gender does not match the sex on their birth certificate as “making a false claim.” Gender identity, the order states, is not “a replacement for sex” and “does not provide a meaningful basis for identification.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Judge James E. Boasberg had threatened to open contempt proceedings to determine whether the Trump administration had violated his order not to deport Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Judge James E. Boasberg had threatened to open contempt proceedings to determine whether the Trump administration had violated his order not to deport Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador. By Alan Feuer A federal appeals court on Friday night put off for the moment a plan by a trial judge to open contempt proceedings to determine whether the Trump administration had violated an order he issued last month stopping flights of Venezuelan migrants from being sent to El Salvador under a powerful wartime statute. In a single-page order, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said that it was entering what is known as an administrative stay to give itself more time to consider the validity of the contempt proposal by the trial judge, James E. Boasberg. On Wednesday, Judge Boasberg, concerned that the White House had ignored his order to pause all deportation flights headed to El Salvador under the wartime law, known as the Alien Enemies Act, gave Trump officials a choice. He said they could provide the men who were sent without hearings to El Salvador the due process they had been denied or they could face a searching contempt investigation into who among them was responsible for having not complied with his directives. In court papers filed on Friday morning, lawyers for the Justice Department told the appeals court that neither option was acceptable. The lawyers accused Judge Boasberg of overstepping his authority by seeking, on the one hand, to tell the Trump administration how to conduct foreign policy and, on the other, to effectively try to assume the role of an investigating prosecutor. The appeals court made clear that it was not ruling on the merits of the Justice Department’s accusations. The panel simply wanted additional time to consider the complexities of Judge Boasberg’s plan. That plan, laid out in an order this week, suggested that the judge was trying to pin down who in the administration was behind what he called the “willful disregard” of his oral instructions issued during a hearing on March 15. Speaking from the bench that day, he said any deportation flights headed to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act needed to be halted at once and that any planes already in the air should turn around.

"A suit challenges the Trump administration’s campaign in four states and Puerto Rico, and seeks the reinstatement of terminated student visas.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by A suit challenges the Trump administration’s campaign in four states and Puerto Rico, and seeks the reinstatement of terminated student visas. By Zach Montague Reporting from Washington A lawsuit filed in New Hampshire late Friday aims to present a sweeping legal challenge to the Trump administration’s campaign targeting international students and academics. Lawyers asked a federal judge to certify a lawsuit brought by foreign students whose visas were canceled as a class action. Cases of international students being detained by masked immigration agents over violations cited by the Trump administration that many individual rights groups have described as protected speech have sparked widespread outrage. But most have been challenged in individual lawsuits. The lawsuit filed in New Hampshire casts a wider net, intending to to stop similar detentions and deportation efforts for students in New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico. It also asks the court to reinstate the student visas that have been terminated. In recent weeks, immigration agencies have rapidly stepped up efforts to punish international students studying in the United States, in many cases because of their involvement in pro-Palestinian protests related to the war in Gaza. In some instances, the lawyers of detained students have described the use of aggressive tactics and students being moved hundreds of miles to detention facilities in Louisiana. Hundreds of students have been swept up in the deportation campaign. Among those whose cases have drawn national attention are Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish graduate student at Tufts University; Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident of the United States who studied at Columbia University; and Momodou Taal, a British-Gambian Ph.D. student at Cornell University. Their cases have also prompted pushback from legal groups over what they say is a threat to campus speech. The new lawsuit challenges those arrests as an arbitrary overreach by immigration officials and a violation of students’ due process rights. In moving to deport the students, the Trump administration has used charged rhetoric. In several cases it has argued that by expressing support for pro-Palestinian demonstrations — sometimes only indirectly — the students’ presence in the United States amounted to a national security threat. Officials have routinely referred to student visas as a privilege that can be revoked at any time and have characterized the students as supporters of “pro-jihadist protests” and terrorism. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of five students from China and India. It did not specify what rationale was given for their visas being terminated. “These terminations — across the board — flout the applicable regulations governing student status termination and the regulations governing failure to maintain student status,” it said. The lawsuit lists an array of harms facing students studying on a visa, including imminent detention and deportation, and loss of their progress toward a degree or graduate research. It noted that as of a week ago, the four states involved and Puerto Rico have collectively seen at least 112 people whose student statuses were terminated. It asked a federal judge to issue a ruling to block the Trump administration from carrying out future detentions and deportations of any student across the nearly 200 accredited colleges and universities in the states involved. Zach Montague is a Times reporter covering the U.S. Department of Education, the White House and federal courts.

Amid the crackling of wooden noisemakers and scattered shouts from the crowd, one voice screaming “Amazona! Amazona!” stuck out. It belonged to her 6-year-old son. Amazona, who when she’s not sitting behind a desk at a logistics firm is elbow-smashing and body-slamming unfortunate souls, couldn’t line up a sitter.

"As Pacific Palisades residents clear debris from January’s wildfires, they’re wrestling with the decision to stay and rebuild or sell and move away.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by As Pacific Palisades residents clear debris from January’s wildfires, they’re wrestling with the decision to stay and rebuild or sell and move away. By Jesus Jiménez Reporting from Pacific Palisades, Calif. For 38 years, Edward Stark called the northwest corner of Merivale and Lachman Lanes home. His house in Pacific Palisades, Calif., was less than two miles from the coast. It had four bedrooms and three baths with a basketball hoop in the backyard. Today, after the Palisades fire tore through the neighborhood in January, his home is a burned, rubble-strewn lot. The stairs from the street are still there, but they don’t lead anywhere. Only parts of brick walls and the chimney remain. The basketball hoop is charred and mangled. So Mr. Stark, 75, came to the same quiet crossroads where thousands of his neighbors had found themselves lately — stay and rebuild or sell and move away. It’s as much a financial decision as an emotional one, as much about real estate as about the future soul of the Palisades. Mr. Stark, a lawyer, decided to sell, with an asking price of $1,899,000. His was one of nearly 200 burned lots in Pacific Palisades that had gone up for sale in recent weeks. Telling his neighbors his decision was one of the hardest things to do. “I was almost embarrassed,” he said. “It’s like I gave up.” The burned lots for sale are a fraction of the more than 3,600 single-family homes that were destroyed in the Palisades fire. But the decisions being made in this early stage of rebuilding offer a glimpse of the challenges and questions facing one of the wealthiest and most scenic enclaves in Los Angeles. As of Friday, 164 lots had been listed for sale, with 19 in escrow and 27 sold since Jan. 7, according to real estate listing data. For Mr. Stark, the choice came down to the waiting.

By Elisabeth Bumiller Reporting from Washington Sometimes the billionaires running the federal government sound like they’re talking to other billionaires. “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” President Trump wrote on social media last week, offering a stock tip that appeared aimed at the investor class rather than ordinary Americans watching their plummeting 401(k)s. Howard Lutnick, the secretary of commerce, has said his mother-in-law wouldn’t be worried if she didn’t get her monthly Social Security check. Elon Musk, who is slashing the Social Security Administration’s staff, has called it a “Ponzi scheme.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has asserted that Americans aren’t looking at the “day-to-day fluctuations” in their retirement savings. And if automakers raise their prices because of Mr. Trump’s tariffs? “I couldn’t care less,” the president told Kristen Welker of NBC. Democrats say the comments show how clueless Mr. Trump and his friends are about the lives of most Americans, and that this is what happens when billionaires run the economy. Republicans counter that highlighting the quotes as unfair cherry picking, and that in the long run everyone will benefit from their policies, even if there’s pain now. Psychologists say that extreme wealth does change people and their views of those who have less. Whoever is right, it is safe to say that almost no one thinks the comments have been politically helpful for Mr. Trump, or calming for Americans. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Their loss could hurt schools and the economy.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Students could bypass the United States for friendlier countries as the Trump administration attacks universities and revokes visas. Their loss could hurt schools and the economy. By Stephanie Saul and Troy Closson Xiaofeng Wan, a former admissions officer at Amherst College, now works as a private consultant to international students who want to come to the United States. This week, as he held meetings in China with prospective students, he sensed a deep uncertainty among their parents. “They really don’t know whether they should send their children to a country where they don’t welcome Chinese students or they see China as a hostile competitor,” Dr. Wan said by telephone from Beijing. “It’s an unprecedented situation that we’ve never seen before.” For years, American colleges and universities have attracted growing numbers of international students who often pay full tuition, effectively subsidizing domestic students. But the Trump administration’s recent move to deport hundreds of students here on visas, and his trade war with China, have stoked fears that the United States is no longer a welcoming place for international students. This week, the administration also asked Harvard to hand over lists of foreign students, adding to a sense of panic on campuses. Suzanne Ortega, president of the Council of Graduate Schools, said the chaos of visa terminations had fueled concerns among many students. “I think it sends a powerful signal to friends and family at home that the U.S. is not a safe place to be anymore,” she said. If the nation gains a reputation for being hostile to international students, it could be devastating for many American colleges and universities.

"The president is trying to rewrite the narrative of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation as a dispute about illegal immigration rather than the rule of law.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by News Analysis The president is trying to rewrite the narrative of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s wrongful deportation as a dispute about illegal immigration rather than the rule of law. By Peter Baker Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent, reported from Washington. In the unlikely yet profound showdown between the president and the migrant that has captured international attention, the courts have uniformly determined that one of them recently violated the law. And it wasn’t the migrant. According to liberal and conservative judges all the way up to the Supreme Court, President Trump’s administration broke the rules by deporting Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia and must try to fix the mistake. But Mr. Trump and his team are trying to rewrite the narrative so that it is a dispute about illegal immigration rather than the rule of law. It is a fight that Mr. Trump seems to welcome. His administration could easily have avoided it by simply bringing Mr. Abrego Garcia back from El Salvador and following a process that might have resulted in him being deported anyway. Instead, Mr. Trump opted to double down, defying the courts and reverse-engineering a justification for a deportation that his administration initially acknowledged was wrong. This in the view of the president’s team is a political winner with the vast majority of voters, an “80-20 issue,” as his adviser Stephen Miller puts it, referring to theoretical percentages. Mr. Trump bolsters his credentials as a scourge of evil immigrants while asserting that his critics care more about foreign-born murderers and thugs than they do about law-abiding Americans. Yet at a time when Mr. Trump is claiming unprecedented power in so many arenas, the case of one imprisoned migrant has come to crystallize the debate about whether Mr. Trump himself is a law-abiding American. The president’s goal in recent days has been to present Mr. Abrego Garcia as such a dangerous man that it does not matter if the government’s deportation was illegal, in effect arguing that the ends justify the means. Never mind that Mr. Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of a crime, the White House now portrays him as a singular threat to public safety without bothering to prove anything in a court of law. At a session with reporters on Friday, aides handed Mr. Trump a sheet with bullet points listing various allegations against Mr. Abrego Garcia, some of them rooted in fact and some of them distorted. He is a “foreign terrorist,” Mr. Trump alleged, and “not a very innocent guy,” someone whose “record is unbelievably bad.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"In an open letter, prominent Republicans criticized President Trump for using his power to punish two former administration officials who criticized him.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by In an open letter, prominent Republicans criticized President Trump for using his power to punish two former administration officials who criticized him. By Karoun Demirjian A number of prominent Republicans, including several former members of the first Trump administration, have signed an open letter decrying the president for using his power to punish two former administration officials who criticized him, likening his actions to those of a “royal despot.” “For a president to personally and publicly direct the levers of the federal government against publicly named citizens for political reasons sets a new and perilous precedent in our republic,” the group wrote. “No matter one’s party or politics, every American should reject the notion that the awesome power of the presidency can be used to pursue individual vendettas.” Earlier this month, Mr. Trump issued two executive orders revoking the security clearances of Chris Krebs, who led the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under during Mr. Trump’s first term and rebutted his claims that the 2020 election had been rigged and stolen, and Miles Taylor, who once served as chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Taylor anonymously wrote a New York Times opinion essay in 2018 accusing Mr. Trump of rampant “amorality” and telling of an internal government “resistance.” Mr. Trump’s executive orders also revoked the security clearances of people and institutions affiliated with Mr. Krebs and Mr. Taylor, and called for investigations into their government tenures. The letter, signed by more than 200 people, criticized those actions as part of a “profoundly unconstitutional break” with precedent. “Behavior of this kind is more to be expected from a royal despot than the elected leader of a constitutional republic,” the signers wrote. “This is the path of autocracy, not democracy.” The letter’s signatories include Ty Cobb, a lawyer who led Mr. Trump’s response to a special counsel’s investigation of his ties to Russia during its early phases, and John Mitnick, who served as general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security until he was fired in 2019 after clashing with the White House. Mr. Cobb and Mr. Mitnick, like many of the other Republicans on the list of signatories, have been openly critical of Mr. Trump since parting ways with his administration. The letter was spearheaded by the State Democracy Defenders Fund, a group run by Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served on the staff of the first team of House Democrats that worked to impeach Mr. Trump in 2019. The Brookings Institution is not involved in the fund, nor was it involved in the letter. Karoun Demirjian is a breaking news reporter for The Times.

Her entertaining website has drawn praise and raised eyebrows. Sabrina Bhattacharjya, 15, at the women’s monument “Something Is Being Done,” in Lexington, Mass., her hometown.Credit...Cassandra Klos for The New York Times Supported by By Dan Barry About 242 years after the Battle of Lexington sparked the Revolutionary War, a resident of the Massachusetts town where it took place realized with childlike enthusiasm that the 250th anniversary would be coming in no time. Huzzah! Obsessed with her hometown’s role in America’s origin story, the resident, Sabrina Bhattacharjya, began planning early for 2025. Very early. Even earlier than the town’s elders, since she had the foresight to lock up the internet domain for Lexington250.com with $53 provided by her financial advisers — her parents. That’s because Sabrina’s full-time position as a first-grader at Bridge Elementary School did not produce a steady income. She was, after all, only 7 years old. But a motivated 7, as resolute as the midnight rider Paul Revere himself to alert other kids in town to the history breathing all around them. It galled her that some children thought Revere was a fictional character, a colonial-era Paul Bunyan. Within five years, Sabrina was using her website to sell T-shirts with historically sassy sayings intended to spark youthful curiosity, but also causing some in town to cough up their mulled cider. Among the phrases was the name of the town — Lexington — followed by a social media abbreviation evoking an emphatic expletive. Like its creator, the site has matured, becoming an inviting resource for all things Lexington, providing history as well as places to eat, sleep and shop. In preparing for this weekend’s semiquincentennial — which sounds like a medical procedure, but simply means 250th anniversary — Sabrina posted an entry with the headline, “For People Who Think The Battle of Lexington Re-enactment Is Coachella: A Perfect Patriots’ Day Weekend.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Thousands of demonstrators rallied at hundreds of events on Saturday to speak out against the president’s handling of immigration, civil liberties, job cuts and many other issues.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Thousands of demonstrators rallied at hundreds of events on Saturday to speak out against the president’s handling of immigration, civil liberties, job cuts and many other issues. By Jesus Jiménez and Minho Kim Jesus Jiménez reported from Los Angeles, and Minho Kim from Washington. Thousands of protesters across the country once again took to the streets on Saturday to rally against President Trump and his policies, a sign of sustained resistance to his leadership just two weeks after cities and towns nationwide saw mass demonstrations. The turnouts in some places like Washington and Chicago appeared to be smaller than the protests on April 5. Several thousand marched in the nation’s capital on Saturday, compared with tens of thousands earlier this month. Still, more than 700 events were planned from Jacksonville, Fla., to Los Angeles for Saturday, according to one of the organizers, the group 50501, and in New York, marchers in Midtown Manhattan filled 15 blocks on Madison Avenue. The participants raged against the president, who they say is trampling on civil liberties and the rule of law, and overreaching in immigration, federal job cuts, the economy and other areas. In front of the White House, protesters repeatedly shouted a single word. “Shame!” Thousands more marched from the Washington Monument. Many demonstrators berated the administration for not bringing Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who the courts have said was wrongfully deported to El Salvador, back to the United States. Waving upside-down American flags, they marched along the eight-lane Constitution Avenue, chanting “Bring Kilmar home.” Trump officials have maintained that Mr. Abrego Garcia was a member of the Salvadoran gang MS-13; he denies the claim.  Julia Fine, a Maryland resident who was holding a sign at the protest by the White House that read “free Garcia,” said the prison in El Salvador where Mr. Abrego Garcia is being held reminded her of “concentration camps.” “That’s where we’re headed with this,” she said. Concerns over the government’s handling of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s case echoed at demonstrations from New York City to Cincinnati to Chicago. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The plane was traveling along the Platte River when it crashed into the water south of Fremont, Neb., on Friday night, officials said.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The plane was traveling along the Platte River when it crashed into the water south of Fremont, Neb., on Friday night, officials said. By Remy Tumin A small plane crashed into a river in eastern Nebraska on Friday night, killing three people on board, officials said. The plane was traveling along the Platte River when it crashed into the water south of Fremont, which is about 40 miles northwest of Omaha, just after 8 p.m., Sgt. Brie Frank of the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office said at a news conference late Friday night. All three bodies were recovered from the crash site with help from agencies that responded, including with airboats, Sergeant Frank said. The identities of the victims were not immediately known. It was not immediately known where the plane was headed or from where it departed. The National Transportation Safety Board said the plane was a Cessna 180 and that an investigator was expected to arrive at the crash scene Saturday afternoon. The board said that once the investigator documented the scene and examined the aircraft, the plane would be taken to a secure facility for further evaluation. The Federal Aviation Administration will also investigate, Sergeant Frank said. Local news reports showed parts of the plane still in the water on Saturday morning.

"In an overnight ruling blocking the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelans, the justices ignored some of their protocols.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by In an overnight ruling blocking the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelans, the justices ignored some of their protocols. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington There are sculptures of tortoises scattered around the Supreme Court grounds. They symbolize, the court’s website says, “the slow and steady pace of justice.” But the court can move fast when it wants to, busting through protocols and conventions. It did so around 1 a.m. on Saturday, blocking the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members under a rarely invoked 18th-century wartime law. The court’s unsigned, one-paragraph order was extraordinary in many ways. Perhaps most important, it indicated a deep skepticism about whether the administration could be trusted to live up to the key part of an earlier ruling after the government had deported a different group of migrants to a prison in El Salvador. That unsigned and apparently unanimous ruling, issued April 7, said that detainees were entitled to be notified if the government intended to deport them under the law, “within a reasonable time,” and in a way that would allow the deportees to challenge the move in court before their removal. There were indications late Friday that the administration was poised to violate both the spirit and letter of that ruling. Lawyers for the detainees said their clients were given notices that they were eligible to be deported under the law, the Alien Enemies Act. The one-page notices were written in English, a language many of them do not speak, the lawyers said. And they provided no realistic opportunity to go to court. The American Civil Liberties Union, racing against the clock, filed its emergency application to the Supreme Court on Friday evening — Good Friday, as it happened — and urged the court to take immediate action to protect the detainees as part of a proposed class action.

"The former congresswoman, a progressive Democrat, campaigned on a promise to unite residents in the beleaguered California city. Her challenger, Loren Taylor, conceded on Saturday.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The former congresswoman, a progressive Democrat, campaigned on a promise to unite residents in the beleaguered California city. Her challenger, Loren Taylor, conceded on Saturday. By Soumya Karlamangla Reporting from Oakland, Calif. Barbara Lee, a progressive lawmaker known for her lone vote against military force after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, won the mayor’s race in Oakland, Calif., less than four months after she retired from a decades-long congressional career. Oakland, a city of about 436,000 residents across the bay from San Francisco, has struggled to bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic shutdowns, and frustrated voters last year recalled Mayor Sheng Thao after she had served less than two years in office. Ms. Lee, 78, was seen in the city as a trusted and experienced voice who could stabilize Oakland and help guide it out of crisis. Her rival, Loren Taylor, a former member of the City Council who ran as more of a moderate, conceded on Saturday after a dayslong vote-counting process. Mr. Taylor, 47, had gained traction with his detailed plan for improving Oakland, and appealed to voters who said they were increasingly fed up with crime and governance problems in the city. In the latest vote tally, Mr. Taylor trailed Ms. Lee by more than 4,700 votes, a gap that is unlikely to be closed by the remaining ballots. Mr. Taylor has received 45 percent of the vote and Ms. Lee 50 percent. After Mr. Taylor’s concession, Ms. Lee said she would address the most pressing problems in Oakland, working to unite a deeply divided city. “I accept your choice with a deep sense of responsibility, humility and love,” she said in a statement. Mr. Taylor said he hoped that Ms. Lee would fulfill her commitment to bring Oakland together by listening to those who had voted for him. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Legal challenges over the powerful wartime law have gone all the way to the Supreme Court.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Legal challenges over the powerful wartime law have gone all the way to the Supreme Court. By Tim Balk In the 36 days since President Trump invoked a powerful wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership, a complex and high-risk legal battle has played out in the federal courts. The Supreme Court has weighed in twice, issuing orders limiting the government’s use of the law, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court’s latest order, which came around 1 a.m. on Saturday, blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas hours after the American Civil Liberties Union said the Trump administration was preparing to expel them without due process. At times, the Trump administration has been accused of disregarding judicial orders as it proceeds with its immigration policies and deportation efforts, deepening legal scholars’ concern that the country could be facing a constitutional crisis. Here is a timeline: March 14: The Trump administration issued an executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act, but the order was not immediately made public. The proclamation said that the government was targeting the violent Venezuelan street gang Tren de Aragua, which it said was threatening an invasion of the United States. The Alien Enemies Act allows the government to detain and expel immigrants age 14 or older without a court hearing when the United States is invaded or at war. It is the fourth time the law has been invoked in American history. March 15: Fearing that the Trump administration was preparing to immediately expel Venezuelans in custody without hearings, the A.C.L.U. filed a lawsuit in federal court in Washington seeking to block the president from invoking the law. The same day, the administration published the executive order. In a hastily scheduled virtual hearing, a federal judge in Washington, James E. Boasberg, was told by the A.C.L.U. that planes were leaving the United States with Venezuelans. He ordered the government not to deport anyone under the law and to return any planes that had already taken off, “however that’s accomplished.” March 16: On social media, El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, published a video of men being led off a plane in handcuffs and taken into a prison in his country. Mr. Bukele posted an article about Judge Boasberg’s order and wrote, “Oopsie… Too late.” The Trump administration insisted it did not violate Judge Boasberg’s order. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement that federal courts “have no jurisdiction” over the president’s handling of foreign affairs.

"All four people aboard the plane were killed when it crashed in a field in Trilla on Saturday, the Illinois State Police said.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by All four people aboard the plane were killed when it crashed in a field in Trilla on Saturday, the Illinois State Police said. By Adeel Hassan A small plane with four people on board crashed on Saturday morning in a field beside a roadway in rural Illinois, officials said. All four people died in the crash, the Illinois State Police said in a statement on Sunday, adding that an “active and ongoing investigation” was taking place at the scene. The plane crashed around 10:15 a.m. in Trilla, about 65 miles south of Champaign. Debris was scattered across the roadway, which was expected to be closed until later Sunday, the police said. The plane, a single-engine Cessna 180, crashed about a dozen miles from Coles County Memorial Airport in Mattoon, Ill., the Federal Aviation Administration said. All of the occupants were from Menomonie, Wis., and were pronounced dead at the scene, the police said. The F.A.A. and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. It was unknown whether anyone on the ground was injured. “We keep those impacted by the plane crash in our thoughts today,” Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois said on social media. “Thank you to the first responders who rushed to the scene.” In the past week, other small plane crashes have killed at least nine people. On Friday night, a small plane crashed into a river in eastern Nebraska, killing three people on board, officials said. On April 12, a small twin-engine plane crashed in a muddy field in New York, killing all six people on board. Flying remains the safest mode of transportation, experts say, but an unusual spate of crashes involving commercial airliners at the start of the year has raised travelers’ anxieties about flying.

"The solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to ‘dissolve’ their temporary block on the deportations of Venezuelans and to allow lower courts to consider the case.",2025-04-19,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The solicitor general asked the Supreme Court to ‘dissolve’ their temporary block on the deportations of Venezuelans and to allow lower courts to consider the case. By Abbie VanSickle Reporting from Washington Trump administration lawyers urged the Supreme Court in a court filing Saturday afternoon to reject an emergency request to temporarily block deportations of Venezuelans under a rarely invoked 18th-century wartime law. Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to “dissolve” the administrative stay they had issued early Saturday that blocked the deportations while they considered the application, and to allow lower courts to weigh in before intervening further in the case. The deportations remain paused while the justices consider the matter. In emergency applications, the Supreme Court can act at any time. In his filing, Mr. Sauer called the request by lawyers for the migrants that the justices step in “fatally premature” and argued that they had “improperly skipped over the lower courts.” He said that the government had provided advance notice to detainees subject to imminent deportation and that they “have had adequate time to file” claims challenging their removal. Mr. Sauer added that the government had agreed it would not deport any detainees with pending claims. The 17-page court filing came hours after a rare overnight ruling by the justices, who in a one-page, unsigned order had blocked the Trump administration from deporting the migrants.

By Hamed AleazizAlan Feuer and Annie Correal Hamed Aleaziz reported from Washington, Alan Feuer from New York and Annie Correal from Mexico City. On Thursday evening, lawyers helping Venezuelan immigrants most at risk of being removed under an 18th-century wartime powers act received an ominous alert: U.S. immigration officials were handing out notices at a detention facility in Texas, informing migrants that they were considered enemies under the law and would be removed from the country. “I am a law enforcement officer authorized to apprehend, restrain and remove alien enemies,” read the notice, a copy of which was filed in federal court by the American Civil Liberties Union. “Accordingly, under the Alien Enemies Act, you have been determined to be an alien enemy subject to apprehension, restraint and removal from the United States.” The notice said the migrant could make a phone call but did not specify to whom. The single-page notice also did not mention any way to appeal the order. The Supreme Court ruled this month that migrants must receive advance notice that they are subject to removal under the rarely invoked wartime powers law — and that they must have an opportunity to challenge their removal in court. News of the notices being handed out at the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Anson, Texas, warning of impending deportations prompted a flurry of legal actions by the A.C.L.U. on Friday in several courts. Early Saturday, the Supreme Court stepped in with unusual speed, ruling that no flights could depart. “The government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this court,” the court said. It is unclear when the justices will make a ruling on whether deportation flights can continue. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The draft executive order would eliminate Africa operations and shut down bureaus working on democracy, human rights and refugee issues.",2025-04-20,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The draft executive order would eliminate Africa operations and shut down bureaus working on democracy, human rights and refugee issues. By Edward Wong Edward Wong is a diplomatic correspondent and former Beijing bureau chief who reports on foreign policy from Washington and often travels with the secretary of state. A draft of a Trump administration executive order proposes a drastic restructuring of the State Department that includes eliminating almost all of its Africa operations and shutting down embassies and consulates across the continent, according to American officials and a copy of the document. The draft also calls for cutting offices at State Department headquarters that address climate change and refugee issues, as well as democracy and human rights concerns. It was not immediately clear who had compiled the document or what stage of internal debates over a restructuring of the State Department it reflected. It is one of several recent documents proposing changes to the department, and internal administration conversations take place daily on possible actions. Some of the ideas have been debated among U.S. officials in recent weeks, though it is unclear to what degree they would be adopted or how active the draft is, officials said. Elements of the draft executive order could change before final White House review or before President Trump signs it, if he decides to do so. Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote a short comment on social media after this article was published, calling it “fake news.” There are no indications that Mr. Rubio or his top aides have signed off on the document, though they have been working on a reorganization of the State Department.

David Goodman Reporting from Houston, Austin and Colleyville, Texas. In 2023, professional bettors in Europe were trying to find an American partner to help pull off an audacious plan to buy up virtually every ticket ahead of just the right lottery draw in the United States. Then something remarkable happened in Texas. Officials in Austin essentially blessed the rigging of their own state lottery. “What we had was a criminal enterprise within our government,” said State Senator Bob Hall, a Republican investigating the caper. In a state known for its aversion to government regulation, the successful manipulation of a Texas lottery has taken on deep meaning. The Texas Senate has held hearings. Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton ordered investigations. The Texas House zeroed out the funding for the state lottery in its budget this month. Still, with their winnings in the tens of millions of dollars, the perpetrators remain very much unscathed. And as the unsavory details have come out — storefronts posing as retailers spitting out lottery tickets, texts between ticket printers and a former drug smuggler, a winner hiding behind a Delaware-based shell company — the escapade underscored a pervasive sense in Texas, and in America, that just about everything is rigged.

"The mayor of the Silicon Valley city has proposed arresting people who don’t accept offers of shelter. It’s the latest sign of frustrations over tent encampments in California.",2025-04-20,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The mayor of the Silicon Valley city has proposed arresting people who don’t accept offers of shelter. It’s the latest sign of frustrations over tent encampments in California. By Soumya Karlamangla Reporting from San Jose, Calif. Not far from the tech campuses that have minted billionaires, residents in Silicon Valley have lost patience with homeless encampments that have sprouted along bike paths and parks in San Jose, Calif. Mattresses, plastic bags and grocery carts have fallen into ravines and choked creeks whose shaded banks once drew hikers, cyclists and kayakers. San Jose closed an entire city park because hundreds of people posed a safety risk by living there permanently in recreational vehicles. Homelessness along Skid Row in Los Angeles and in the Tenderloin in San Francisco has long defined the problem in California, but the most intense battles this year over encampments have emerged elsewhere in the state. Local leaders have vowed to take more aggressive steps, making use of a Supreme Court decision last year that empowered them to penalize people for sleeping on the street. In San Jose, Mayor Matt Mahan, a Democrat, recently called for arresting homeless people if they refused shelter three times. It’s rare for leaders in the liberal Bay Area to adopt such an approach, which critics say criminalizes homelessness. But his idea has drawn widespread support. While there remains opposition, interviews with residents, elected officials and advocates show that rising frustration with homelessness is making Silicon Valley voters desperate for action and leading them to proposals that once would have seemed too right-leaning for these heavily blue cities.

"For decades, the share of American Catholics declined in the face in secularization. But in recent years, those numbers have stabilized, buoyed by growing communities and broader societal changes.",2025-04-20,"The New York Times","  Standing-room-only Masses at one parish in Las Vegas draw about 1,200 people each, according to its pastor.Credit...Roger Kisby for The New York Times Supported by By Kate Selig A lively Mass with mariachi music in San Antonio. A monthly potluck for Filipino Catholics in New York City. Parishes in Las Vegas so crowded that some attendees must stand. These are some of the faces of the Catholic Church in the United States this Easter weekend — a moment marked by both celebration and mourning after the death of Pope Francis on Monday. For decades, the share of American Catholics declined in the face of broader trends in secularization. But those numbers have stabilized in recent years, according to the latest survey data from the Pew Research Center, buoyed by growing immigrant communities across the West and the South and by broader societal changes that are transforming Catholic identity. About 78 percent of Asian Catholics in the United States were born outside the country, and another 14 percent are the children of immigrants — the highest proportion of any ethnic group for which Pew has sufficient data. While Asian Catholics now make up only about 4 percent of the U.S. Catholic population, that number has ticked up since the 2000s. At St. Mary Gate of Heaven, a parish in Queens in New York City, Filipino parishioners pack in on the first Sunday of each month for a Mass offered in Tagalog. (Most Filipino Americans are Catholic, according to Pew.) The service is followed by a potluck in the church basement where people bring Filipino dishes such as lumpia, adobo and cassava cake.

"Kash Patel’s embrace of the spotlight appears to be a break from the recent past, as his predecessors typically did the job with little fanfare.",2025-04-20,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Kash Patel’s embrace of the spotlight appears to be a break from the recent past, as his predecessors typically did the job with little fanfare. By Adam Goldman and Aric Toler Adam Goldman reported from Washington, and Aric Toler from Kansas City. Kash Patel flew to Miami on Air Force One last weekend to watch an Ultimate Fighting Championship event, wearing his signature wraparound sunglasses — at least the second time he has gone to a mixed-martial arts fight as F.B.I. director. Days earlier, he showed up at two N.H.L. games, grinning in photographs with the hockey legend Wayne Gretzky. At one, in Washington, Mr. Patel, who has played the sport since he was a child, was spotted in the owner’s suite as he watched the Capitals player Alex Ovechkin tie Mr. Gretzky’s scoring record. And since taking over the agency, Mr. Patel has been a noticeable presence at President Trump’s side, delivering a warm-up speech at the Justice Department before Mr. Trump himself spoke and hovering behind him during the U.F.C. match in Miami. Mr. Patel, 44, seems to relish his new status as director, cutting a highly visible path while running the most important law enforcement agency in the nation. His embrace of the spotlight appears to be a break from the recent past. Previous directors did the job with little fanfare, deflecting any attention that might detract from the work of the bureau. “As director, I had never sought publicity or the spotlight that sometimes corners public officials,” Louis Freeh, the bureau’s fifth director, wrote in his memoir. The last three directors have been a mix of personalities, all intent on operating at arm’s length from the president. Robert S. Mueller III was known as serious and laconic. His successor, James B. Comey, was considered a powerful orator who did not shrink from making headlines. Christopher A. Wray, who stepped down before Mr. Trump took office rather than get fired, fell somewhere in between Mr. Mueller, who did not speak enough, and Mr. Comey, who spoke too much, former agents said. (They pointed to Mr. Comey’s infamous news conference and two letters to Congress during the 2016 campaign that upended the presidential election.)

An earlier meeting between Mr. Vance and church officials involved “an exchange of opinions” on migration. transcript Hello. So good to see you. I pray for you every day. God bless you. Happy Easter. By Emma Bubola Reporting from Rome Vice President JD Vance met with Pope Francis at the pontiff’s residence in Rome on Sunday, the Vatican said, in a previously unannounced visit during Easter celebrations. The Vatican said the meeting was a “brief” exchange of Easter wishes that lasted “a few minutes.” In a photograph released by the Vatican, the pope is seated in a wheelchair opposite Mr. Vance as the pair talk. The meeting came after the pope criticized the Trump administration’s deportation policies and urged Catholics to reject anti-immigrant narratives, in an unusually direct attack on the American government. The rebuke came in the form of an open letter to American bishops in February, with some of the pope’s criticisms apparently leveled directly at statements made by Mr. Vance. Mr. Vance, who was baptized as a Catholic six years ago, has been spending Holy Week in Rome with his family. He attended the Good Friday service in St. Peter’s Basilica. On Saturday, Mr. Vance met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, and with Archbishop Paul Gallagher, the Vatican’s foreign minister. Mr. Vance had not been expected to meet the pope, who only recently left the hospital after spending five weeks there in serious condition. The pope has made unannounced appearances since his hospital stay, but his health tightly restricts his planned engagements. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the court’s overnight order blocking the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelans under a wartime law was not “necessary or appropriate.”",2025-04-20,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the court’s overnight order blocking the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelans under a wartime law was not “necessary or appropriate.” By Abbie VanSickle Abbie VanSickle covers the Supreme Court. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. dissented in the Supreme Court’s decision on Saturday to block the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members under a rarely invoked 18th century wartime law, calling the court’s order “hastily and prematurely granted.” In his five-page dissent released on Saturday shortly before midnight, Justice Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote that in his view, the court’s decision to intervene overnight was not “necessary or appropriate.” The court’s unsigned, one-paragraph order came after a fast-moving legal battle late Friday. The American Civil Liberties Union had rushed to several lower courts, then to the Supreme Court, claiming that the Trump administration was planning to deport more Venezuelan migrants, presumably to El Salvador, with little to no due process under the wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act. The Supreme Court’s decision ordered a pause on the deportations of the detainees while it considers the emergency application. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote that the Supreme Court’s decision to block the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants under a wartime law was premature. The order suggested a deep skepticism on the court about whether the Trump administration could be trusted to live up to the key part of an earlier ruling that said detainees were entitled to be notified if the government intended to deport them under the law, “within a reasonable time,” and in a way that would allow the deportees to challenge the move. “In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief,” Justice Alito wrote in his dissent, “without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order.” Justice Alito said that he had refused to join the court’s order because “we had no good reason to think that, under the circumstances, issuing an order at midnight was necessary or appropriate.” Abbie VanSickle covers the United States Supreme Court for The Times. She is a lawyer and has an extensive background in investigative reporting.

"“Facilitating his return means something more than doing nothing, and they are doing nothing,” Senator Chris Van Hollen said after his trip to El Salvador.",2025-04-20,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by “Facilitating his return means something more than doing nothing, and they are doing nothing,” Senator Chris Van Hollen said after his trip to El Salvador. By Minho Kim Reporting from Washington Senator Chris Van Hollen on Sunday accused the Trump administration of “outright defying” court orders to return a wrongly deported Maryland man whom Mr. Van Hollen met with in El Salvador last week, and he urged the administration to stop releasing unfavorable records about the man. “They are flouting the courts as we speak,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Facilitating his return means something more than doing nothing, and they are doing nothing.” Mr. Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, traveled to El Salvador last week to press for the release of the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was deported to a notorious Salvadoran prison in March in what an administration lawyer described as an “administrative error.” A federal appeals court on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to take a more active role in bringing back Mr. Abrego Garcia, a few days after the Supreme Court ruled that the government should “facilitate” his return from El Salvador. Instead, the White House has publicized an allegation of domestic abuse from Mr. Abrego Garcia’s wife from 2021, when she sought a protective order. Mr. Abrego Garcia’s wife said last week that the two “were able to work through this situation privately.” The administration also cited a police filing from a Tennessee trooper who stopped Mr. Abrego Garcia on a highway in 2022 and raised suspicion of human trafficking. Federal law enforcement officials instructed the trooper not to detain him, and Mr. Abrego Garcia’s wife has said he routinely drove workers to their jobs.

"The defense secretary sent sensitive information about strikes in Yemen to an encrypted group chat that included his wife and brother, people familiar with the matter said.",2025-04-20,"The New York Times","Signal Leaks Advertisement Supported by The defense secretary sent sensitive information about strikes in Yemen to an encrypted group chat that included his wife and brother, people familiar with the matter said. By Greg JaffeEric Schmitt and Maggie Haberman Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared detailed information about forthcoming strikes in Yemen on March 15 in a private Signal group chat that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer, according to four people with knowledge of the chat. Some of those people said that the information Mr. Hegseth shared on the Signal chat included the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets targeting the Houthis in Yemen — essentially the same attack plans that he shared on a separate Signal chat the same day that mistakenly included the editor of The Atlantic. Mr. Hegseth’s wife, Jennifer, a former Fox News producer, is not a Defense Department employee, but she has traveled with him overseas and drawn criticism for accompanying her husband to sensitive meetings with foreign leaders. Mr. Hegseth’s brother Phil and Tim Parlatore, who continues to serve as his personal lawyer, both have jobs in the Pentagon, but it is not clear why either would need to know about upcoming military strikes aimed at the Houthis in Yemen. The previously unreported existence of a second Signal chat in which Mr. Hegseth shared highly sensitive military information is the latest in a series of developments that have put his management and judgment under scrutiny. Unlike the chat in which The Atlantic was mistakenly included, the newly revealed one was created by Mr. Hegseth. It included his wife and about a dozen other people from his personal and professional inner circle in January, before his confirmation as defense secretary, and was named “Defense | Team Huddle,” the people familiar with the chat said. He used his private phone, rather than his government one, to access the Signal chat. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"The staggering amount, disclosed in a filing with the Federal Election Commission, was driven by corporate America’s eagerness to win the president’s favor.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The staggering amount, disclosed in a filing with the Federal Election Commission, was driven by corporate America’s eagerness to win the president’s favor. By Theodore Schleifer Reporting from Washington President Trump raised $239 million for his inauguration festivities in January, a norm-shattering amount fueled by corporate America’s desire to curry favor with a famously transactional president. The total, disclosed in a filing with the Federal Election Commission on Sunday, is more than double the previous record of $107 million set by Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee in 2017. About 140 different people or companies gave at least $1 million to the effort, including blue-chip companies like JPMorgan Chase, Delta Air Lines and Target. The committee, known formally as the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee, is required by federal law to report the names of donors and the dollar amounts for contributions over $200 to the F.E.C. no more than 90 days after the Jan. 20 ceremony. It is not required to report how it spent the money. Many of the donations to Mr. Trump’s inauguration were previously announced — such as $1 million each from tech giants like Meta and Amazon — in part because companies wanted it known widely that they were backing Mr. Trump’s formal return to power. But the report revealed a few names not well-publicized, including several friends of Elon Musk, such as tech investors like John Hering, Ken Howery and Keith Rabois, who each gave $1 million. (Neither Mr. Musk, a top presidential adviser, nor any of his companies donated.) The three largest contributions came from a poultry producer, Pilgrim’s, which donated $5 million; a crypto company, Ripple Inc., which donated just under that; and Warren Stephens, a Republican donor who gave $4 million on the same day, Dec. 2, that Mr. Trump named him as his pick to be ambassador to Britain. Inaugurations, even with several days of elaborate dinners and other events, have never cost anything near roughly a quarter-billion dollars, and the amount raised by the committee will resurface questions about where any leftover funds might go. The committee has not said how much money it has spent, but the president’s allies have said that the remaining amount will be funneled to other Trump-sponsored projects, primarily a nonprofit organization that will build his presidential library.

"President Nayib Bukele said he would free the Venezuelans that the Trump administration deported to El Salvador if Venezuela released the same number of prisoners, including members of the opposition.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by President Nayib Bukele said he would free the Venezuelans that the Trump administration deported to El Salvador if Venezuela released the same number of prisoners, including members of the opposition. By Annie Correal and Julie Turkewitz Annie Correal reported from San Salvador. El Salvador’s president proposed on Sunday repatriating Venezuelan detainees sent to his country from the United States in exchange for the release of prisoners by Venezuela, including key figures in the Venezuelan opposition. “I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that includes the repatriation of 100 percent of the 252 Venezuelans who were deported, in exchange for the release and surrender of an identical number (252) of the thousands of political prisoners you hold,” President Nayib Bukele wrote in an X post directed at President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela. Since March, the U.S. government has sent Venezuelans and Salvadorans accused of being affiliated with the Tren de Aragua and MS-13 gangs to El Salvador, where Mr. Bukele agreed to hold convicted criminals for the United States, for a fee. Venezuela’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, demanded the immediate release of the Venezuelans held in El Salvador late Sunday in a statement responding to Mr. Bukele. Mr. Saab didn’t say whether the Venezuelan government would consider the proposal. The first flights to arrive in El Salvador carried 238 Venezuelans, many of whom were found not to have criminal records. Mr. Maduro responded explosively to the detention of Venezuelans by El Salvador’s government, telling Mr. Bukele not to be “an accomplice in this kidnapping.” Among the political prisoners in Venezuela named in Mr. Bukele’s post were several people detained by the Maduro government in a crackdown last year.

"State efforts to urge the Supreme Court to reconsider same-sex marriage have not advanced, but they have reopened the issue.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Religious Charter School Challenge Advertisement Supported by State efforts to urge the Supreme Court to reconsider same-sex marriage have not advanced, but they have reopened the issue. By Amy Harmon It has been more than a decade since same-sex marriage dominated the national political discourse. Public opinion turned rapidly toward acceptance well before the Supreme Court established same-sex marriage as a national right in 2015. By 2021, a Gallup poll showed that most Americans, including a majority of Republicans, favored legal recognition of such marriages, and ahead of the Republican National Convention in 2024, Donald J. Trump ordered the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman removed from his party’s platform. But in state legislatures across the country this year, there is new activity on the same-sex marriage front — and echoes of the issue’s long, contentious past. In half a dozen states, Republican lawmakers have introduced resolutions urging the Supreme Court to overturn its 2015 decision, Obergefell v. Hodges. In Tennessee, a Republican legislator has proposed a new category of “covenant” marriages between “one male and one female.” And in several states, including Virginia and Oregon, Democrats are laying the groundwork to repeal old state statutes and constitutional amendments that prohibited same-sex marriage, which could come back into effect should Obergefell be overturned. No one is suggesting that reconsideration of the decision in Obergefell is imminent. Still, the number of state measures proposed signals an effort to shift the perception of same-sex marriage as an established civil right, leaders on both sides of the issue say. “We have to prepare for the worst,” Jeremy Moss, the state’s first openly gay state senator, wrote in a piece for The Detroit Free Press under the headline, “Gay marriage isn’t safe in Michigan.” Mr. Moss, a Democrat, called for a ballot initiative to protect same-sex marriage after Representative Josh Schriver, a House Republican, introduced a resolution asserting that the Supreme Court’s decision had “confused the American family structure” and proposing that the Michigan Legislature condemn it. Resolutions like Mr. Schriver’s, calling on the Supreme Court to undo Obergefell, carry no legal authority, and no state has approved such a resolution so far.

This week, she is trying to reset.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Los Angeles is rebuilding, but new crises are mounting and Mayor Karen Bass has been haunted by her absence when the fires started. This week, she is trying to reset. By Shawn Hubler Reporting from Los Angeles It was 8:40 a.m., and Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles was in stop-and-go traffic in the back of a black SUV. She was already an hour and a half into her day one morning last week, which started with the dismantling of a quarter-mile-long homeless encampment. As local merchants embraced her, an amputee, a toddler and 43 other people were moved to shelter. Now, she was headed to Pacific Palisades, to give a rebuilding update at the spot where the Jan. 7 wildfires leveled a library. Scrolling on her phone, she sorted through details of a nearly $1 billion projected city budget shortfall. One crisis. And then another. And still another. All while a fourth, no less real or urgent, loomed in the background — her own political future as she runs for re-election next year. As Los Angeles has emerged from the January wildfires, its mayor has worked overtime, straining to speed up recovery, while the Trump administration takes aim at liberal-run cities, global uncertainty rocks the economy and Los Angeles prepares to host the 2028 Olympics and part of next year’s World Cup. But as challenges mount, Ms. Bass has struggled to gain traction. The fact that she was out of the country during the wildfires in January still haunts her.

"Baby bonuses and menstrual cycle classes are among the ideas pitched to Trump aides as they consider plans to try boosting the birthrate.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Trump Administration  Baby bonuses and menstrual cycle classes are among the ideas pitched to Trump aides as they consider plans to try boosting the birthrate.  Baby bonuses and menstrual cycle classes are among the ideas pitched to Trump aides as they consider plans to try boosting the birthrate. “We need to channel the MAHA spirit and really dive deep into infertility,” said Emma Waters, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation, referring to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Make America Healthy Again campaign.Credit...Rebecca Kiger for The New York Times Supported by By Caroline Kitchener Caroline Kitchener writes about the American family. The White House has been hearing out a chorus of ideas in recent weeks for persuading Americans to get married and have more children, an early sign that the Trump administration will embrace a new cultural agenda pushed by many of its allies on the right to reverse declining birthrates and push conservative family values. One proposal shared with aides would reserve 30 percent of scholarships for the Fulbright program, the prestigious, government-backed international fellowship, for applicants who are married or have children. Another would give a $5,000 cash “baby bonus” to every American mother after delivery. A third calls on the government to fund programs that educate women on their menstrual cycles — in part so they can better understand when they are ovulating and able to conceive. Those ideas, and others, are emerging from a movement concerned with declining birthrates that has been gaining steam for years and now finally has allies in the U.S. administration, including Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk. Policy experts and advocates of boosting the birthrate have been meeting with White House aides, sometimes handing over written proposals on ways to help or convince women to have more babies, according to four people who have been part of the meetings who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Administration officials have not indicated what ideas — if any — they might ultimately embrace. But advocates expressed confidence that fertility issues will become a prominent piece of the agenda, noting that President Trump has called for a “baby boom” and pointing to the symbolic power of seeing Mr. Vance and other top officials attend public events with their children.

"Parents in Maryland say they have a religious right to withdraw their children from classes on days that storybooks with gay and transgender themes are discussed.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Parents in Maryland say they have a religious right to withdraw their children from classes on days that storybooks with gay and transgender themes are discussed. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington In preparing for a Supreme Court argument on Tuesday over the role of religion in public schools, the justices and their law clerks have considered the usual pile of briefs, pleadings, declarations and exhibits. But this time the key documents in the court record are seven colorful books for young children, with sparse text and cheerful illustrations. They include “Pride Puppy,” an alphabet primer about a family whose puppy gets lost at a Pride parade; “Love, Violet,” about a girl who develops a crush on her female classmate; “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding,” about a same-sex union; and “Born Ready,” about a transgender boy. Those books are at the center of the case, which asks whether parents’ rights to the free exercise of their faiths are burdened if public schools do not allow them to withdraw their children from classes on days that books with gay and transgender characters and themes are discussed. Montgomery County Public Schools, Maryland’s largest school system, added the books in 2022 to the curriculum for students from prekindergarten through fifth grade. The school system’s list included, its lawyers told the justices, “a handful of storybooks featuring lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer characters for use in the language-arts curriculum, alongside the many books already in the curriculum that feature heterosexual characters in traditional gender roles.” At first, the Montgomery school system gave parents notice when the storybooks were to be discussed, along with the opportunity to have their children excused from those sessions. But the school system soon eliminated the advanced notice and opt-out policy, saying it was hard to administer, led to absenteeism and risked “exposing students who believe the storybooks represent them and their families to social stigma and isolation.” Parents of several faiths sued, saying the books violated the First Amendment’s protection of the free exercise of religion. The books, their complaint said, “promote one-sided transgender ideology, encourage gender transitioning and focus excessively on romantic infatuation.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Four House Democrats traveled to El Salvador on Monday to press for the release of a Maryland resident who was mistakenly deported there last month, and to demand updates on him and other migrants who are imprisoned there. The visit was the latest bid by Democrats in Congress to amplify the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man whom Trump administration officials have admitted to erroneously sending back to his home country, and the hundreds of other immigrants the administration has hastily deported in violation of federal judges’ orders to allow them a chance to challenge their treatment. Representatives Robert Garcia of California, Maxwell Alejandro Frost of Florida, Yassamin Ansari of Arizona and Maxine E. Dexter of Oregon met with William H. Duncan, the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, at the embassy in San Salvador on Monday morning. They urged the ambassador to raise the issue with Salvadoran officials and to press for transparency about Mr. Abrego Garcia’s detention, which they argued contravened both judicial orders by American judges and international norms. The lawmakers said they had not been permitted by Salvadoran officials to meet with Mr. Abrego Garcia themselves. After their meeting, a U.S. Embassy official, who was not authorized to comment and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the lawmakers’ concerns had been relayed to the Salvadoran government. The members of Congress also raised the case of Andry Jose Hernandez Romero, a Venezuelan makeup artist who was detained for months in California and was among those deported from the United States last month. The official said it was the first time the embassy had raised questions to President Nayib Bukele’s administration about the treatment of more than 250 Venezuelan migrants now being held in Salvadoran custody.

"Pope Francis’ transformative vision for the American church made it more open, but also energized conservative resistance that further divided it.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Pope Succession   Pope Francis addressed a joint meeting of Congress in 2015. He was the first and only Pope to do so.Credit...Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Supported by By Elizabeth Dias and Ruth Graham Elizabeth Dias and Ruth Graham cover religion and faith. Months into his papacy in 2013, Pope Francis was asked about gay priests, and he responded, “Who am I to judge?” Across the United States, Catholics and non-Catholics alike took a collective gasp. For years the Roman Catholic Church in the United States had deeply aligned with the religious right in fierce conflicts over issues like abortion, gay marriage and contraception. But Pope Francis wanted a church “with doors always wide open,” as he said in his first apostolic exhortation. Words like these made the new pope a revolutionary figure in the United States, in both the Catholic Church and the nation’s politics. He challenged each to shift its moral focus toward issues like poverty, immigration and war, and to confront the realities of income inequality and climate change. Pope Francis offered a progressive, public Catholicism in force, coinciding with the Obama era, and at the beginning of his pontificate, he moved the U.S. church forward from the sex-abuse scandals that roiled his predecessor’s pontificate. He pushed church leaders to be pastors, not doctrinaires, and elevated bishops in his own mold, hoping to create lasting tonal change in the church through its leadership. He gave voice to the growing share of Hispanic Catholics, as the American church grew less white, and appointed the first African-American cardinal. He allowed priests to bless same-sex couples and made it easier for divorced and remarried Catholics to participate in church life. In doing so, he captured the imaginations of millions both inside and outside the American church who had long felt rejected. At a time of increasing secularization, the world’s most visible Christian leader gave hope to many U.S. non-Catholics who saw in him a moral visionary while much of public Christianity in America took a rightward turn.

"His critics were fellow clergy as well as elected officials in the ascendant wing of the American Catholic political realm.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Pope Succession Advertisement Supported by His critics were fellow clergy as well as elected officials in the ascendant wing of the American Catholic political realm. By Ruth Graham and Elizabeth Dias Ruth Graham and Elizabeth Dias report on religion for the Times. A few months before he died on Monday, Pope Francis entered what turned out to be his last high-profile skirmish with his flock in the United States. In a letter in February to American bishops, with whom he had his own complicated relationship over the years, the pope criticized President Trump’s treatment of migrants, claiming that deportations violate the “dignity of many men and women, and of entire families.” Though he didn’t name names, he also seemed to to rebut Vice President JD Vance’s recent interpretation of a Catholic theological concept. Mr. Vance, who is Catholic, met briefly with Pope Francis at his home in Rome on Easter Sunday, making the vice president among the last people to see the ailing pontiff alive. The slap in February, with its intertwining layers of politics and theology, was typical of the often fraught public relationship between Pope Francis and conservative American Catholics. When Pope Francis took office in 2013, many Catholics in the United States were optimistic that his emphasis on inclusivity and ministry to the margins would lead to a “Francis effect” that would enliven the American church for years to come. Pope Francis did end up energizing American Catholics, but not only in the way his supporters hoped. His papacy galvanized a traditionalist stream that had always existed in the American church, and that strengthened and expanded throughout his papacy as a tide of resistance rose in the American church hierarchy, in Washington and in the pews. Pope Francis’ critics represent a minority of the American church but a powerful one. They were not only fellow clergy but also elected officials in a newly ascendant wing of the American Catholic political realm, as Catholic power in Washington developed harder edges in the final months of his life. President Trump stocked his cabinet with conservative Catholics, and elevated Mr. Vance as vice president, a Catholic convert whose views on church doctrine are deeply enmeshed with his political priorities. Catholics make up more than a third of Mr. Trump’s cabinet, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio. But Pope Francis’ critics in the American church had objections that ranged far beyond disagreements over public policy. Critics, including some clergy, have accused him of sowing confusion on bedrock church doctrines, and at the same time of wielding an autocratic leadership style behind a facade of humility and informality. He was seen as haphazardly rushing the church into the future, at a time when many American traditionalists were questioning the changes of Vatican II.

I’m going to go roll some Easter eggs with my kids.” “Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. Just the same old stuff from the media. That’s an old one. Try finding something new.” By Jonathan SwanAishvarya Kavi and Michael Gold Reporting from Washington President Trump threw his support behind Pete Hegseth on Monday and said any concern over his defense secretary’s decision to share military attack plans in a Signal group chat was a “waste of time.” Speaking to reporters on the White House’s South Lawn after the Easter Egg Roll, Mr. Trump said he had full confidence in Mr. Hegseth. “He’s doing a great job — ask the Houthis how he’s doing,” the president said, referring to the rebel group in Yemen that the United States targeted in military strikes last month. The New York Times reported on Sunday that Mr. Hegseth had shared details about those strikes on March 15 — before they happened — in a message thread that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer, according to four people with knowledge of the chat. The details were essentially the same attack plans that Mr. Hegseth had shared on a separate Signal chat the same day that mistakenly included the editor of The Atlantic. The decision to close ranks around Mr. Hegseth comes as Mr. Trump has so far been unwilling to fire any of his top officials, no matter what headlines they generate — a marked change from his first term. People who had discussed the matter with the president said he was determined to dig in and wanted to see Mr. Hegseth fight back. Mr. Trump has been adamant, in private, about not giving the “fake news” media the satisfaction of seeing him fire one of his top officials in a scandal.

"An appeals court had struck down a Minnesota law that applied to 18- to 20-year olds, saying it violated a new Second Amendment test focusing on history.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by An appeals court had struck down a Minnesota law that applied to 18- to 20-year olds, saying it violated a new Second Amendment test focusing on history. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court on Monday turned down an opportunity to weigh in on whether the government may restrict 18- to 20-year-olds from buying or carrying guns, a question that has divided the lower courts. The case concerned a Minnesota law that makes it a crime for people under 21 to carry guns in public. Last year, the Eighth Circuit struck down the law, ruling that the Second Amendment required letting those as young as 18 be armed. “The Second Amendment’s plain text does not have an age limit,” wrote Judge Duane Benton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush. He relied on the 26th Amendment, which lowered the voting age to 18 in 1971. The amendment, Judge Benton wrote, “unambiguously places 18- to 20-year-olds within the national political community.” Lower courts have struggled to apply recent Supreme Court decisions that transformed Second Amendment law by introducing a new test to judge the constitutionality of gun control measures. As Justice Clarence Thomas put it in his 2022 majority opinion in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, such laws must be struck down unless they are “consistent with this nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.” Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s attorney general, had urged the justices to return the case to the appeals court for reconsideration in light of United States v. Rahimi. In that case, decided last year, the Supreme Court ruled that the government can temporarily disarm people subject to restraining orders for domestic violence.

By Edgar Sandoval Reporting from El Paso. A state judge sentenced Patrick Crusius, a self-described white nationalist with a history of mental illness, to life in prison on Monday for killing 23 people and injuring 22 others in 2019 at a Walmart store in El Paso, one of the deadliest attacks on Hispanic civilians in American history. Judge Sam Medrano Jr. handed down the sentence before hearing impact statements from family members and survivors. “You traveled nine hours to a city that would have welcomed you with open arms,” Judge Medrano told the gunman. “You brought not peace but hate. You came to inflict terror, to take innocent lives.” “Your mission failed,” the judge continued. “You did not divide this city. You strengthened it.” Mr. Crusius, looking disheveled in a white and orange prison jumpsuit, did not betray any emotions as the judge read his sentence, other than to say that he pleaded guilty to capital murder, with its automatic life sentence, and to 22 counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He has no chance of parole. He replied, “Yes, your honor” when asked if he accepted his fate. The sentence was handed down in a large room, usually used by the county commission, that was converted to a courtroom to accommodate a large crowd.

Ms. Noem also confirmed the theft at the White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday morning. The department did not give specifics, but said it could confirm the details of a CNN article, which said that Ms. Noem’s bag also contained her driver’s license, medication, apartment keys and blank checks. “Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren,” the department said via email. “She was using the cash withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities and Easter gifts.” The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington on Monday referred questions to the Secret Service, which itself referred questions to Homeland Security. Ms. Noem, the Republican governor of South Dakota before joining the Trump administration, has drawn attention for her provocative social media posts, including a video from a Salvadoran prison in which she wore an Immigration and Customs Enforcement cap and a Rolex watch. As homeland security secretary, Ms. Noem runs a department that is in charge of the nation’s security. Its responsibilities include border control and immigration, terrorism protection and cybersecurity.

"The California Democrat’s request came the day after it was revealed that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth discussed sensitive military operations in a second Signal chat including family members.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Signal Leaks Advertisement Supported by The California Democrat’s request came the day after it was revealed that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth discussed sensitive military operations in a second Signal chat including family members. By Michael Gold Reporting from Washington Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, requested in a letter on Monday that the National Archives and Records Administration investigate the Trump administration’s use of Signal and other messaging applications, raising concern that top officials were recklessly using them to discuss sensitive national security matters in potential violation of federal laws that require them to preserve records. Mr. Schiff’s letter came the day after The New York Times reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used Signal to share sensitive information about planned strikes on Yemen in a group chat that included his wife and brother. That chat was the second reported instance of Mr. Hegseth sharing highly sensitive military information outside secure government channels, after it was revealed last month that he shared attack plans in a separate Signal group with other Trump officials that also mistakenly included The Atlantic’s editor, Jeffrey Goldberg. Mr. Schiff, who as a congressman led the Democrats’ case for Mr. Trump’s first impeachment trial, asked the Archives to take steps to preserve any messages that Trump administration officials sent on the encrypted messaging app. “Given the reckless and careless manner by which the administration utilized the messaging application in this context, there is a strong reason to believe that senior political appointees have engaged widely in such practices when discussing other sensitive national security matters,” Mr. Schiff wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The Times. He also urged a broader review of how all senior Trump administration officials use messaging applications and platforms like Gmail, and whether agencies had policies in place to preserve communications there. And he asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is acting as the national archivist following President Trump’s abrupt firing of the previous one, to recuse himself from any inquiries and to instead turn an investigation over to the Justice Department or independent inspectors general. Mr. Schiff’s letter was the latest attempt by Democrats to push for outside oversight of the administration in the face of a Republican-controlled Congress that has shown little interest in conducting any scrutiny of the White House.

"The justices heard arguments in a constitutional challenge to a task force that decides what treatments are covered at no cost.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The justices heard arguments in a constitutional challenge to a task force that decides what treatments are covered at no cost. By Abbie VanSickle Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court appeared divided during arguments on Monday over the constitutionality of a provision of the Affordable Care act that can require insurance companies to offer some types of preventive care for free. At issue is a part of the 2010 health care law that established a task force that determines certain kinds of preventative health measures that insurance companies are required to cover. Two small Christian businesses that provide health insurance to their employees, along with some Texas residents, had sued the federal government, challenging the constitutionality of the task force. In particular, they had objected on religious grounds to the task force’s approval of no-cost H.I.V. medications, claiming the drugs “encourage and facilitate homosexual behavior.” But the case, Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, could have broader implications for tens of millions of Americans who receive a wide array of free health care services, including cancer and diabetes screenings, medications to reduce heart disease and strokes, and eye ointment for newborns to prevent infections causing blindness. A ruling in favor of the challengers could mean that insurers would no longer be required to offer free coverage for any care the United States Preventive Services Task Force has recommended since 2010.

"The plainclothes guards were involved in the forcible removal of a woman from a meeting hosted by local Republicans in Coeur d’Alene, prosecutors said.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The plainclothes guards were involved in the forcible removal of a woman from a meeting hosted by local Republicans in Coeur d’Alene, prosecutors said. By Christine Hauser Six men who prosecutors said took part in forcibly removing a woman from a town-hall meeting hosted by local Republicans in Coeur d’Alene, a small city in northern Idaho, in February are facing charges including battery and false imprisonment. The Coeur d’Alene Prosecutor’s Office said in a statement on Monday that four of the men — Paul Trouette, Russell Dunne, Christofer Berg and Jesse Jones — face charges of battery and false imprisonment. Along with Alexander Trouette IV, they were also cited for security agent uniform and agent duty violations. A sixth man, Michael Keller, has been charged with battery, the statement said. The charges stem from an altercation on Feb. 22 that began when Teresa Borrenpohl heckled speakers at a meeting with state legislators hosted by the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee. Organizers said that Ms. Borrenpohl, a former Democratic candidate for state office, refused to follow the rules, but she said everyone should be allowed to speak. Sheriff Robert Norris of Kootenai County told Ms. Borrenpohl to leave, pulled at her arm and threatened to arrest and pepper-spray her, according to footage of the incident. The sheriff gestured to two men beside him, who then approached Ms. Borrenpohl, pulled her to the floor and dragged her out of the high school auditorium where the meeting was being held. The men were wearing green tactical pants and black tactical shirts, according to a police report. They were later identified as personnel with Lear Asset Management Inc., a private security firm based in California that is licensed in multiple states.

"Harvard’s lawsuit comes after the administration sought to force the university to comply with a list of demands by cutting billions in federal funding the school receives.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Harvard’s lawsuit comes after the administration sought to force the university to comply with a list of demands by cutting billions in federal funding the school receives. By Stephanie Saul Harvard, the world’s wealthiest university, sued the Trump administration on Monday, fighting back against its threats to slash billions of dollars from the school’s research funding as part of a crusade against the nation’s top colleges. The lawsuit signaled a major escalation of the ongoing fight between higher education and President Trump, who has vowed to “reclaim” elite universities. The administration has cast its campaign as a fight against antisemitism, but has also targeted programs and teaching related to racial diversity and gender issues. Earlier this month, it sent Harvard a list of demands that included auditing professors for plagiarism, reporting to the federal government any international students accused of misconduct, and appointing an outside overseer to make sure that academic departments were “viewpoint diverse.” Alan M. Garber, Harvard’s president, accused the government in a statement on Monday of trying to wield “unprecedented and improper control.” Dr. Garber said the consequences of the government’s actions would be “severe and long lasting.” The Trump administration has claimed that Harvard and other schools have allowed antisemitic language and harassment to remain unchecked on their campuses. Monday’s lawsuit noted that the government had cited the university’s response to antisemitism as justification for its “unlawful action.” Dr. Garber, in his statement, said that “as a Jew and as an American, I know very well that there are valid concerns about rising antisemitism.” But he said that the government was legally required to engage with the university about the ways it was fighting antisemitism. Instead, he said, the government has sought to control “whom we hire and what we teach.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"The request by American Oversight came after revelations that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared information on upcoming strikes in more than one group chat.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Signal Leaks Advertisement Supported by The request by American Oversight came after revelations that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared information on upcoming strikes in more than one group chat. By Alan Feuer A nonprofit watchdog group on Monday broadened a lawsuit it filed last month against several top national security officials in the Trump administration, asking a federal judge to force them to preserve all messages they have sent as part of their official business on Signal, an encrypted communications app. The amended suit was filed one day after The New York Times reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared detailed information about forthcoming strikes in Yemen on March 15 in a private Signal group chat that included his wife, brother and personal lawyer. The watchdog group, American Oversight, filed an initial version of its suit in Federal District Court in Washington, shortly after Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he had been inadvertently added to a separate Signal group chat in which top Trump officials — including Mr. Hegseth, the C.I.A. director John Ratcliffe and Vice President JD Vance — discussed sensitive details about the strikes in Yemen against Houthi rebels. The fact that Mr. Hegseth also shared information about the strikes in a second Signal chat indicates “that the use of Signal to conduct official government business by administration officials is widespread,” the amended lawsuit said. The suit continued: “Senior administration officials used, and likely continue to use, a commercially available text message application with an auto-delete function and no apparent mechanism to fully preserve federal records on government record keeping systems.” American Oversight’s new request to Judge James E. Boasberg, who is overseeing the case, would cover any Signal messages about official business sent by or received from Mr. Hegseth and Mr. Ratcliffe, along with Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence; Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary; and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Late last month, Judge Boasberg ordered all of the officials to preserve the messages on the initial Signal chat, known as the “Houthi PC Small Group Chat.” Alan Feuer covers extremism and political violence for The Times, focusing on the criminal cases involving the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and against former President Donald J. Trump.

"Mr. Hilton is the second prominent Republican to enter the wide-open race. He faces difficult odds in the Democratic-led state.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Mr. Hilton is the second prominent Republican to enter the wide-open race. He faces difficult odds in the Democratic-led state. By Laurel Rosenhall Reporting from Sacramento Steve Hilton, a former Fox News host who has also worked in conservative politics in Britain, announced on Monday that he was running to become California’s next governor. Mr. Hilton is the second prominent Republican to enter the 2026 race, but he faces difficult odds considering that California voters have not elected a Republican to statewide office since they re-elected Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006. Gov. Gavin Newsom cannot run for re-election because of term limits, creating a wide-open contest that has already attracted several elected Democrats and Chad Bianco, the Republican sheriff of Riverside County. The field, however, is waiting for former Vice President Kamala Harris to decide whether she will enter the race. If she does so, several Democrats could end their bids out of deference to Ms. Harris, their party’s presidential candidate last year. But her entrance could have the opposite effect with Republican hopefuls, who may be eager to take on the former vice president. Mr. Hilton, 55, has been a supporter of President Donald J. Trump. But in recent media appearances, he has tried to avoid culture war issues and focused more on reducing costs and regulations for California businesses, lowering the cost of living in the state, curbing crime and reducing homelessness. California remains a heavily Democratic state. But Mr. Hilton may be hoping that the electorate’s shift in last year’s presidential election will benefit his campaign. In 2024, Mr. Trump flipped 10 California counties that he had lost in 2020, and voters statewide overwhelmingly passed a measure that made it easier to prosecute theft and drug crimes.

"At the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth could not avoid the news about another chat that involved sensitive details about forthcoming military strikes.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Signal Leaks Advertisement Supported by At the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth could not avoid the news about another chat that involved sensitive details about forthcoming military strikes. By Aishvarya Kavi Reporting from Washington The South Lawn of the White House was a hubbub of activity on Monday morning as a crowd of revelers dressed in spring colors gathered for the annual Easter egg roll. A brown-eared Easter Bunny greeted the crowd, the first lady read a children’s story — and the president and his defense secretary lashed out at the media. The Times reported on Sunday that Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon chief, had shared sensitive details about forthcoming military strikes in a second group chat in the Signal app, one that included members of his family and his personal lawyer. President Trump and Mr. Hegseth had not responded to the report ahead of the festivities at the White House on Monday morning. So when journalists who had assembled to cover the event tracked down the two to ask about the situation, their responses were a departure from the Easter cheer. Mr. Hegseth, wearing an American flag pocket square, appeared furious as he railed at reporters. His children shuffled their feet behind him. “These kids right here,” Mr. Hegseth said, gesturing to them as he looked directly into the lens of a television camera, “this is why we’re fighting the fake news media.” He pointed an accusatory finger at the gathered group of journalists: “This group right here — full of hoaxters. You peddle anonymous sources from leakers with axes to grind and then you put it all together as if it’s some news story.” He placed an arm around his wife — who was included in the Signal chat in question — and ushered the family away. transcript “We’re happy to be here at the Easter Egg Bowl, I’ll tell you that — A few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out. Hoaxsters. This group — no, no, no, — this group right here, full of hoaxsters that peddle anonymous sources from leakers with axes to grind, and then you put it all together as if it’s some news story. I’m going to go roll some Easter eggs with my kids.” “Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. Just the same old stuff from the media. That’s an old one. Try finding something new.” Elsewhere on the lawn, the president could not avoid questions. Flanked by the first lady, Melania Trump, and an Easter Bunny in a pale green jacket, Mr. Trump addressed the crowd from a balcony and spoke about Pope Francis, whose death was announced by the Vatican overnight. Serenaded by live music from a Marine Corps band, the Trumps descended into the crowd, which included reporters. There, the questions about the Signal chat began. “Why would you even ask a question like that?” Mr. Trump said to one reporter who asked whether he still had confidence in Mr. Hegseth. He rejoined his family, including his eldest son and several grandchildren, and the first couple presided over an egg roll. “Are you ready?” Mr. Trump asked the gathered children before counting to three and blowing on a gold whistle. But he was quickly distracted again by the journalists assembled behind them. “Look at that, look behind you,” he told Mrs. Trump. One young grandson standing next to them also squinted curiously at the reporters. “The best people. They have good days and they have bad days — but we all do, right?” Before he turned back to the festivities, he considered making an offering to the journalists. “Do you want an egg?” he asked. “We’ll give you a couple of eggs.” Aishvarya Kavi works in the Washington bureau of The Times, helping to cover a variety of political and national news.

"Elon Musk talks a lot about the birthrate. The Trump administration is looking for ways to raise it.",2025-04-21,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Newsletter Elon Musk talks a lot about the birthrate. The Trump administration is looking for ways to raise it. By Jess Bidgood Elon Musk might be this country’s most famous pronatalist. He has a well-documented obsession with the declining birthrate, which he believes could doom humanity. “Unless that changes,” he told Bret Baier last month, “civilization will disappear.” He has also taken this on as something of a personal mission. Musk has at least 14 children with several women, according to The Wall Street Journal, which reported that he calls his offspring his “legion,” after the armies with which ancient Rome expanded its empire. And he has built a compound in Texas to house his family, as my colleagues Kirsten Grind, Ryan Mac and Sheera Frenkel reported last year. Musk also sees the nation’s birthrate as a pressing issue of public policy. “It should be considered a national emergency to have kids,” he posted on X last June. He has also said that people should be taught to fear childlessness rather than fearing pregnancy. He’s part of a movement of conservatives who want more people to have more babies, and who believe that policy can encourage this. It’s a movement that has never had so much political power in America. My colleague Caroline Kitchener has a fascinating story today that explores how pronatalism is weaving itself into the West Wing and beyond. Trump aides are hearing out proposals that would offer financial incentives for women to give birth — including an idea for a $5,000 “baby bonus” — or promote more education about women’s menstrual cycles and fertility windows. Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, has pledged to prioritize transportation funding to areas with higher rates of birth and marriage. And White House aides, Caroline reported, are preparing a report for mid-May about how to make I.V.F. more widely accessible. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The mistakes, miscommunications and flip-flops are piling up after an early run defined by a flood of major policy changes that were rolled out at breakneck speed.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by News Analysis The mistakes, miscommunications and flip-flops are piling up after an early run defined by a flood of major policy changes that were rolled out at breakneck speed. By Luke Broadwater Luke Broadwater is a White House correspondent. He reported from Washington. When President Trump assessed his team’s performance in late March, he boasted that the White House had executed “two perfect months.” Border crossings were down. Military recruitment was up. The stock market was humming. Mr. Trump was achieving his maximalist policy goals with efficiency and minimal internal drama, a notable change from his first term. The White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, known as the “ice maiden,” received much of the credit. But in recent weeks, the veneer of a more disciplined White House has begun to crack. The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, shared sensitive military information in not one, but two Signal group chats. The I.R.S. has had three different leaders in the span of a single week. A Salvadoran man living in Maryland was deported because of an “administrative error.” And, in yet another misstep, administration officials kicked off a war of threats with Harvard University by sending a letter to the school prematurely, two people familiar with the matter said. While the chaos has not reached the first Trump administration’s levels, the mistakes, miscommunications and flip-flops have started piling up after an early run defined by a flood of major policy changes at breakneck speed. “There was a good reason to believe it would be more disciplined this time around,” said Hans C. Noel, a government professor at Georgetown University. Conservative groups, through Project 2025, laid the groundwork for Mr. Trump to quickly enact his agenda upon taking office. Almost immediately, the president opened investigations of his perceived enemies, issued sweeping executive orders and slashed the federal work force as part of a flood-the-zone strategy aimed at distracting his opponents and throwing them off balance.

"Demonstrators sought the release of Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil, who organized pro-Palestinian protests and have been taken into ICE custody.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Demonstrators sought the release of Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil, who organized pro-Palestinian protests and have been taken into ICE custody. By Anvee Bhutani About 10 demonstrators chained themselves to Columbia University’s campus gates at 116th Street and Amsterdam Avenue in New York on Monday afternoon, protesting the detention of two Palestinian student activists by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. They were part of a larger contingent that sat down outside the gate. The protest followed the detention last week of Mohsen Mahdawi, who is finishing undergraduate studies in philosophy at Columbia’s School of General Studies. Mr. Mahdawi was taken into ICE custody during his naturalization appointment in Vermont. Federal immigration officials detained Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate of the School of International and Public Affairs, last month. Both were organizers of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia. Demonstrators on Monday called for the immediate release of Mr. Mahdawi and Mr. Khalil. They held signs reading, “Free all our political prisoners” and chanted, “We want justice, you say how? Free Mohsen Mahdawi now!” They also read aloud Mr. Khalil’s writings from the detention center in Jena, La., where he is being held. A Columbia spokesperson said Monday that the university was “monitoring a disruption” and that its public safety officers had cut the locks of about 10 demonstrators. “We will follow all applicable policies and procedures for addressing potential violations,” the Columbia spokesperson said. “This small disruption has not impeded the ability of our students to attend classes as normal; all scheduled campus activities have proceeded as planned.” The New York Police Department said Monday evening that an unspecified number of people had been taken into custody and were being processed. It was unclear what charges they would face. One of those who was detained had been trying to pitch a tent, the police said. It was the second protest this month in which demonstrators attached themselves to Columbia’s gates.

"Experts in federal employment law said the Trump administration’s justifications to end the investigations were baffling at best.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Federal Layoffs Advertisement Supported by Experts in federal employment law said the Trump administration’s justifications to end the investigations were baffling at best. By Eileen Sullivan Eileen Sullivan covers changes to the federal work force under the Trump administration. She reported from Washington. The independent government agency charged with protecting federal workers’ rights will drop its inquiry into the more than 2,000 complaints that the Trump administration had improperly fired probationary employees, according to emailed notices received by five workers and reviewed by The New York Times. The agency, the Office of Special Counsel, told affected employees that it had concluded that it could not pursue the claims of unlawful termination in part because they were fired not for individual cause, but en masse as part of President Trump’s “governmentwide effort to reduce the federal service.” The decision effectively eliminates one of the few avenues government employees had to challenge their terminations. It comes as Mr. Trump has forced out the office’s leader and replaced him for now with Jamieson Greer, who is also serving as U.S. trade representative. The office is charged with protecting whistle-blowers from retaliation, which is the reason for its independent status and a Senate-confirmed leader. But it also scrutinizes other employment-related issues, including investigations into claims of prohibited personnel practices, or PPPs, such as discrimination, nepotism or an attempt to coerce political activity. Reached for comment, the Office of Special Counsel declined to say how many of the more than 2,000 fired probationary employees with pending complaints actually received the notice.

"Retail executives huddled with the president amid fears that tariffs could result in higher prices.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by Retail executives huddled with the president amid fears that tariffs could result in higher prices. By Tony Romm Reporting from Washington When President Trump’s steep tariffs threatened to send the price of iPhones soaring, Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, called the White House — and soon secured a reprieve for his company and the broader electronics industry. Almost immediately, top aides to Mr. Trump insisted they had not strayed from their promise to apply import taxes across the economy with minimal, if any, exceptions. But the carve-out still caught the attention of many businesses nationwide, igniting a fresh scramble for similar help in the throes of a global trade war. Top lobbying groups for the agriculture, construction, manufacturing, retail and technology industries have pleaded with the White House in recent days to relax more of its tariffs, with many arguing that there are some products they must import simply because they are too expensive or impractical to produce in the United States. On Monday, executives from retailers including Home Depot, Target and Walmart became the latest to raise their concerns directly with Mr. Trump, as the industry continues to brace for the possibility that steep taxes on imports could result in price increases for millions of American consumers. “We had a productive meeting with President Trump and our retail peers to discuss the path forward on trade, and we remain committed to delivering value for American consumers,” a Target spokesman, Jim Joice, said in a statement. Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive, has previously acknowledged the many “variables” surrounding Mr. Trump’s tariffs and retail prices. A spokeswoman for Walmart confirmed the meeting on Monday, describing the conversation in a statement as “productive.” Other companies did not respond to requests for comment.

"The world’s richest university may have enough money to survive a battle with the most powerful man in the world. But if Trump wins, Harvard won’t be the same.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by The world’s richest university may have enough money to survive a battle with the most powerful man in the world. But if Trump wins, Harvard won’t be the same. By Alan Blinder and Stephanie Saul The world’s wealthiest university is under attack by one of the world’s richest, most powerful men. The reasons have to do with disagreements about antisemitism, racial politics and raw power. But the fight, which the government accelerated with a mistimed letter, is also about taking Harvard and its billions down several notches. The Trump administration has frozen more than $2.2 billion in grants and contracts that were intended for Harvard, which is also America’s oldest institution of higher education. As Harvard and President Trump face off over the government’s intrusive demands, the university’s riches have emerged as a flashpoint. Mr. Trump has made it clear that he may want to take every last penny the government sends to the institution — and, if the Internal Revenue Service strips Harvard of its tax-exempt status, maybe collect more from the university, too. On Monday, the university sued the administration, arguing the government had overstepped. The question is whether Harvard can handle the blow if its legal effort is unsuccessful. Harvard was sitting on $64 billion at the end of its most recent fiscal year, after factoring in its various debts. By comparison, this year’s Massachusetts state budget is worth about $58 billion. Harvard has schools ranging from divinity to dentistry and more than 100 research centers, giving the university an especially wide range of projects. Note: Figures are for fiscal year 2023.

"The Democratic representative from suburban Detroit is likely to be seen as a centrist in the primary contest to replace Senator Gary Peters, who is retiring.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Democratic representative from suburban Detroit is likely to be seen as a centrist in the primary contest to replace Senator Gary Peters, who is retiring. By Katie Glueck Representative Haley Stevens, a moderate Democrat who represents suburban Detroit, entered the race for Senate in Michigan on Tuesday, casting herself as a proud native daughter pushing back against Trumpian chaos. “The same groceries cost more each month, housing’s more expensive than ever,” said Ms. Stevens in her announcement video, as images of President Trump and his close adviser, Elon Musk, flash across the screen. “What the heck are they doing?” Ms. Stevens, who joined Congress in 2019 after flipping a Republican-held seat, represents affluent, vote-rich Oakland County, a onetime Republican stronghold that is now a vital Democratic bastion. She is the latest Democrat to join an increasingly crowded and competitive primary race to succeed Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat who is retiring. The open-seat contest, in one of the most closely divided states in the country, is likely to be a marquee race in 2026, as Democrats strain to regain control of the Senate. Ms. Stevens, a strong fund-raiser who is the chair of the center-left New Democrat Coalition Action Fund, will be seen as a centrist in the primary contest. A former chief of staff for the Obama administration’s auto task force, she is leaning into her support for manufacturing and the auto industry. And, speaking in her distinctive Michigan accent, she opened her announcement video by telling the story of her first car. “That used Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, it meant more to me than just freedom,” Ms. Stevens said. “It meant I had a piece of Michigan.

But for Mr. Prada, 32, it proved fateful. The U.S. authorities took Mr. Prada into custody when he attempted to re-enter the country; he was put in detention and ordered deported. On March 15, he told a friend in Chicago that he was among a number of detainees housed in Texas who expected to be repatriated to Venezuela. That evening, the Trump administration flew three planes carrying Venezuelan migrants from the Texas facility to El Salvador, where they have been ever since, locked up in a maximum-security prison and denied contact with the outside world. But Mr. Prada has not been heard from or seen. He is not on a list of 238 people who were deported to El Salvador that day. He does not appear in the photos and videos released by the authorities of shackled men with shaved heads. “He has simply disappeared,” said Javier, a friend in Chicago, the last person with whom Mr. Prada had contact. The friend spoke about Mr. Prada on condition that he be identified only by his middle name, out of fear that he too could be targeted by the immigration authorities.

"The defense secretary’s inner circle is in disarray, and distrust is growing among civil servants and senior military officials.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Signal Leaks Advertisement Supported by The defense secretary’s inner circle is in disarray, and distrust is growing among civil servants and senior military officials. By Greg Jaffe and Helene Cooper Reporting from Washington Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrived at the Pentagon in January with almost no government experience and huge ambitions to remake the way the military was being run. In just three months in office, Mr. Hegseth, a former Fox News host, has instead produced a run of chaos that is unmatched in the recent history of the Defense Department. Mr. Hegseth’s inner circle of close advisers — military veterans who, like him, had little experience running large, complex organizations — is in shambles. Three members of the team he brought with him into the Pentagon were accused last week of leaking unauthorized information and escorted from the building. A fourth recently departed member of Mr. Hegseth’s team, John Ullyot, who had been his top spokesman, accused Mr. Hegseth of disloyalty and incompetence in an opinion essay in Politico on Sunday. “The building is in disarray under Hegseth’s leadership,” Mr. Ullyot wrote. The discord, according to current and former defense officials, includes: screaming matches in his inner office among aides; a growing distrust of the thousands of military and civilian personnel who staff the building; and bureaucratic logjams that have slowed down progress on some of President Trump’s key priorities, such as an “Iron Dome for America” missile-defense shield. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal business. Adding to the dysfunction, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has set a loose target of slashing as many as 200,000 jobs from the Pentagon’s civilian work force of 750,000, a level of cuts Mr. Hegseth has warned would cripple some critical functions within the department, three current and former defense officials said.

"Gen. Dan Caine’s first official trip underscored how the White House has prioritized the mission, which now involves nearly 7,000 active-duty troops.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Gen. Dan Caine’s first official trip underscored how the White House has prioritized the mission, which now involves nearly 7,000 active-duty troops. By Eric Schmitt Gen. Dan Caine, the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made an unannounced visit to the southwestern border over the weekend for a firsthand look at the military’s growing role in helping to stem migrant crossings, a top priority for President Trump. That General Caine made his first official trip to the border as chairman underscores the importance of the mission to the White House, and the Pentagon, even as crossings have dropped precipitously during the Trump administration. General Caine, a former Air Force F-16 fighter pilot, visited the military headquarters for the operation at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., on Saturday. He then took a 30-minute Blackhawk helicopter ride to a Border Patrol station at Douglas, Ariz., where he received briefings, the Joint Staff said on social media on Tuesday. The Pentagon has dispatched nearly 7,000 active-duty troops along the border from California to Texas, including armed infantry and support troops from the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson in Colorado. The military is also flying surveillance drones and other reconnaissance aircraft and has ordered two Navy ships to conduct patrols along the Pacific and Gulf coasts. General Caine’s visit came after Mr. Trump this month announced a plan to turn a narrow strip along the Mexican border in California, Arizona and New Mexico into a military installation as part of his effort to curtail illegal crossings. The plan, set out in a White House memo, calls for transferring authority over the 60-foot-wide strip of federal land, known as the Roosevelt Reservation, to the Defense Department from other cabinet agencies. Military forces patrolling that area could then temporarily detain migrants passing through for trespassing on a military reservation, the Pentagon’s Northern Command said in a statement on Monday. Dispatching large numbers of frontline combat forces underscores how Mr. Trump is breaking with past presidents’ recent practice of mostly limiting deployments along the U.S.-Mexico border to small numbers of active-duty soldiers and reservists. So far, the active-duty troops have been helping to build barriers and support law-enforcement agencies, as have active-duty and reservist forces sent to the border in past years, including during Mr. Trump’s first term. But Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on his first full official day on the job in January that “whatever is needed at the border will be provided.” He did not rule out Mr. Trump’s invoking the Insurrection Act, a more than 200-year-old law, to allow the use of armed forces for law enforcement duty. Taking such an action would plunge the military into politically charged territory that has deeply concerned congressional Democrats. The Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security are expected to forward recommendations to the White House in the next few days on whether Mr. Trump should invoke the Insurrection Act. Eric Schmitt is a national security correspondent for The Times, focusing on U.S. military affairs and counterterrorism issues overseas, topics he has reported on for more than three decades.

"The I.M.F. and World Bank are holding their spring meetings as President Trump’s trade war upends the global economy.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The I.M.F. and World Bank are holding their spring meetings as President Trump’s trade war upends the global economy. By Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington Global economic leaders are gathering in Washington this week for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. They are arriving in a United States that is vastly different from the one they visited during the same forum last fall. Recent debates over industrial policy and whether the world economy could achieve a soft landing have been replaced by anxiety over President Trump’s trade war, revived inflation fears and new worries about the prospect of a global recession. The multilateral institutions that are hosting the meetings and that receive funding from the United States are also under increasing pressure to prove their relevance to the Trump administration while avoiding confrontations that could compel Mr. Trump to withdraw from them entirely. “The post-World War II rules-based system of global governance, which the United States played a key role in fashioning, is crumbling before our eyes,” said Eswar Prasad, a former China director of the I.M.F. “The Trump administration has left little doubt about its distaste for practically every multilateral institution, including the I.M.F. and the World Bank, because it views these institutions’ recommendations and policies as not always perfectly aligned with narrowly defined American interests,” Mr. Prasad said. Mr. Trump has ratcheted up tariffs to their highest levels in more than a century, creating widespread global economic uncertainty and most likely disrupting supply chains. At the same time, a sharp pullback in U.S. foreign aid is putting sudden pressure on poor countries that have for decades relied on American support to provide food and medicines for the world’s most vulnerable populations. Mr. Trump has said little publicly about the I.M.F. or the World Bank since taking office in January. But officials at both institutions have been watching warily as the president upends the global trading system, rapidly overhauls the federal government and cracks down on foreign nationals working and studying in the United States.

"The International Monetary Fund expects slower growth and higher inflation in the U.S. as a result of President Trump’s trade policies.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The International Monetary Fund expects slower growth and higher inflation in the U.S. as a result of President Trump’s trade policies. By Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington President Trump’s trade war is expected to slow economic growth across the globe this year, in large part because his aggressive use of tariffs is likely to weigh heavily on the United States, the world’s largest economy. The economic projections were released on Tuesday by the International Monetary Fund, in the wake of Mr. Trump’s decision to raise tariffs to levels not seen since the Great Depression. The president has imposed a 10 percent tariff on nearly all imports, along with punishing levies of at least 145 percent on Chinese goods that come into the United States. Mr. Trump also imposed what he calls “reciprocal” tariffs on America’s largest trading partners, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, although he has paused those until July as his administration works to secure bilateral trade deals. Mr. Trump’s approach has created paralyzing uncertainty for U.S. companies that export products abroad or rely on foreign inputs for their goods, dampening output just as economies around the world were stabilizing after years of crippling inflation. China and Canada have already retaliated against Mr. Trump’s tariffs with their own trade barriers, and the European Union has said it is prepared to increase levies if the United States goes ahead with its planned 20 percent tax. The World Economic Outlook report projects that global output will slow to 2.8 percent this year from 3.3 percent in 2024. In January, the fund forecast that growth would hold steady in 2025. The I.M.F. also expects output to be slower next year than it previously predicted. Much of the downgrade for this year can be attributed to the impact of the tariffs on the U.S. economy, which was already poised to lose momentum this year. The I.M.F. expects U.S. output to slow to 1.8 percent in 2025, down from 2.8 percent last year. That is nearly a full percentage point slower than the 2.7 percent growth that the I.M.F. forecast for the United States in January, when it was the strongest economy in the world.

"The sharp rebuke by a federal judge in Maryland suggested that she had lost her patience with the Trump administration’s recalcitrance in the case.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The sharp rebuke by a federal judge in Maryland suggested that she had lost her patience with the Trump administration’s recalcitrance in the case. By Alan Feuer A federal judge in Maryland blasted the Trump administration on Tuesday for flouting her instructions to answer questions about what steps it had taken, and planned to take, in seeking the release of a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador last month. The sharp rebuke by the judge, Paula Xinis, contained in an eight-page order, suggested she had lost her patience with the Justice Department’s pattern of stonewalling her in the case involving the deported man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. In her order, Judge Xinis accused the department of “a willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.” She also dismissed as “specious” its attempts to evade providing information about how Mr. Abrego Garcia ended up in a Salvadoran prison by claiming that it amounted to privileged state secrets. “For weeks, defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this court’s orders,” Judge Xinis wrote, giving vent to her frustrations. “Defendants have known, at least since last week, that this court requires specific legal and factual showings to support any claim of privilege. Yet they have continued to rely on boilerplate assertions. That ends now.” On Tuesday morning, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers wrote to Judge Xinis, accusing the government of “producing nothing of substance” in response to a list of 15 questions and 15 requests for documents that they had given to the Justice Department in an effort to determine what, if anything, the White House had done to free Mr. Abrego Garcia from Salvadoran custody. The lawyers asked the judge to hold a hearing on Wednesday in Federal District Court in Maryland to decide how to proceed. But the judge, indicating that she had reached the end of her rope, skipped past a courtroom conversation altogether and simply told the government what it had done wrong. She ordered the Justice Department to supply all the requested detail by 6 p.m. Wednesday or risk losing its claims of privilege. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Elon Musk’s group says it saved $318 million by canceling a “request for proposal” from the Office of Personnel Management but did not release the request itself.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Elon Musk’s group says it saved $318 million by canceling a “request for proposal” from the Office of Personnel Management but did not release the request itself. By David A. Fahrenthold Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has posted an online “Wall of Receipts” to provide the proof behind its claims to have cut billions from the federal budget. But one of the most important receipts is missing. The group says that it saved $318,310,328 by canceling a “request for proposal” that the Office of Personnel Management put out last year, seeking bids for a potential contract. But it has not provided the request itself. Neither have the White House nor the Office of Personnel Management, despite requests from The New York Times. On Tuesday, the Senate’s top Democrat sent a letter to Charles Ezell, the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management, requesting that the agency release that document — and proof that it had been canceled. “By failing to provide clear documentation and denying access to records surrounding this solicitation, O.P.M. has made it impossible to determine whether the cancellation of this proposal resulted in the savings DOGE has claimed,” the senator, Chuck Schumer of New York, wrote in his letter. “The public is left in the dark as to whether these savings are based on real, verifiable data.” David A.

"The secretary of state aims to eliminate an office that advances American values abroad in a plan aligning the agency with President Trump’s foreign policy approach.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","U.S.A.I.D. Advertisement Supported by The secretary of state aims to eliminate an office that advances American values abroad in a plan aligning the agency with President Trump’s foreign policy approach. By Edward Wong and Michael Crowley Reporting from Washington Secretary of State Marco Rubio unveiled a plan on Tuesday to make major cuts to the State Department as part of a restructuring, calling the government’s diplomatic agency “bloated, bureaucratic” and “beholden to radical political ideology.” Mr. Rubio released the plan in the form of an organizational chart and a brief official statement. The move is the latest by the Trump administration to reduce and reshape the government to a degree unseen in generations, which critics call a shortsightedly blunt assault on the federal bureaucracy. The announcement on Tuesday is only the first step in an overhaul of the department. It focused on changes to operations in Washington, but the cuts will affect the work of embassies and consulates overseas. Closures of diplomatic missions and layoffs abroad are expected later, according to U.S. officials and earlier leaked memos. The most dramatic change is the elimination of the office of the under secretary for civilian security, democracy and human rights, which is charged with advancing American values around the world. Trump administration officials call the office a hotbed of liberal activism. Some elements of that office, including a bureau for democracy and human rights and one for refugees, would be cut and folded into an office for foreign assistance and humanitarian aid, according to the reorganization chart posted on the State Department website. A counternarcotics bureau would also be cut and moved under an international security office. The department released an internal fact sheet that provided more details on Mr. Rubio’s plan, including reducing the agency’s total number of bureaus and offices from 734 to 602, or by 18 percent. About 700 positions would be cut, a senior department official said. The sheet did not specify the vast majority of the offices, though two prominent ones to be eliminated are Global Criminal Justice and Conflict and Stabilization Operations.

"Investigators are looking into how bettors were allowed to guarantee themselves a $95 million jackpot win, as state leaders question whether the lottery should go on.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Investigators are looking into how bettors were allowed to guarantee themselves a $95 million jackpot win, as state leaders question whether the lottery should go on. By J. David Goodman The executive director of the Texas State Lottery resigned abruptly on Monday in the latest fallout from the agency’s decision in 2023 to help professional bettors in Europe purchase and print millions of its tickets and guarantee themselves a $95 million jackpot win. The resignation of the official, Ryan Mindell, came amid doubts that the Texas lottery can survive the scandal. The Texas Rangers, a state law enforcement agency, and the Texas attorney general’s office have opened investigations into the 2023 draw, in which the European bettors worked with several American lottery ticket purchasing companies to buy nearly every ticket, at $1 each, in a Lotto Texas game that had 25.8 million possible combinations. The lottery raises money for the state’s schools — providing about $2 billion last fiscal year — but recently some state leaders have suggested doing away with it altogether. No reason was given for Mr. Mindell’s resignation, which the commission said in a statement was effective immediately on Monday. A spokesman declined to comment further. The resignation came a day after The New York Times published video of the ticket printing operation and details of the agency’s shortcomings. That followed months of reporting by The Houston Chronicle and other outlets looking into the 2023 draw. Earlier this month, the Texas House eliminated the lottery from its version of the state’s budget. In February, State Senators sharply questioned Mr. Mindell and others during hearings on the 2023 draw. Some suggested the lottery had been used to facilitate money laundering, though no evidence of such activity had emerged. “Is buying $25 million of $1 tickets a sign of money laundering, yes or no?” Senator Paul Bettencourt asked Mr. Mindell during one exchange. “I can’t answer that question,” Mr. Mindell said. “Wow,” Mr. Bettencourt responded. Mr. Mindell took over the commission last year after the resignation of the previous executive director, Gary Grief, who had been in charge at the time of the 2023 draw. Lawmakers found that the commission, under Mr. Grief, assisted the professional bettors by expediting delivery of dozens of extra lottery terminals, used to buy and print tickets, to three American companies, Lottery.com, Luck Zone and Lottery Now. The extra machines enabled the companies to successfully print millions of number combinations during the 72-hour window between lottery draws, helping to ensure that they had the winner. Mr. Grief has denied any wrongdoing, as have the companies involved and the European bettors. J. David Goodman is the Houston bureau chief for The Times, reporting on Texas and Oklahoma.

By Stephanie Saul A day after Harvard sued the Trump administration over its decision to freeze billions in federal funds to the school, more than 220 higher education leaders from around the country signed a joint statement on Tuesday condemning the administration’s efforts to control universities. The government’s “political interference” and “overreach” is “now endangering higher education in America,” they wrote. The signers come from a variety of colleges and universities from across the country, as well as higher education associations, illustrating the breadth of the threat they say President Trump poses to academia. Joining in the statement were officials from large public research universities like the University of Virginia and the University of Wisconsin-Madison and smaller private colleges such as Amherst and Kenyon. The statement, circulated by the American Association of Colleges and Universities and signed by a total of 224 people as of Tuesday afternoon, focuses on concerns that the Trump administration is attacking academic freedom. “We must oppose undue government intrusion into the lives of those who learn, live and work on our campuses,” the statement said. Many of the presidents who signed, including Alan M. Garber of Harvard, also face financial risks as a result of the administration’s deep cuts to research contracts and grants. Dr. Garber on Monday said his school had chosen to sue the administration after it issued a list of demands that included auditing its professors for plagiarism and appointing an outside overseer to ensure its departments were “viewpoint diverse.” Harvard refused to comply with the demands, and the administration said it would freeze $2.2 billion in federal money. Stephanie Saul reports on colleges and universities, with a recent focus on the dramatic changes in college admissions and the debate around diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.

"The new Army Fitness Test comes after Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, ordered the elimination of lower fitness standards for women in combat roles.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The new Army Fitness Test comes after Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, ordered the elimination of lower fitness standards for women in combat roles. By Jonathan Wolfe Women in U.S. Army combat roles will be expected to pass the same “sex-neutral” physical test as male soldiers, that military branch announced on Monday, weeks after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the elimination of lower physical fitness standards for women in combat. The change could hinder the Army’s ability to recruit and retain women in particularly dangerous military jobs. The new test, the Army Fitness Test, will replace the Army Combat Fitness Test, and “is designed to enhance Soldier fitness, improve warfighting readiness, and increase the lethality of the force,” the Army wrote in its announcement. The new scoring standards will be phased in beginning on June 1, the Army said. Like its forerunner, the new test will be administered to active duty soldiers twice a year, and once per year to National Guard and Reserve troops. If soldiers fail the test two times in a row, they may be removed from the Army. The new fitness test is very similar to the previous one. It consists of five events: dead lifts, push-ups, planks, a two-mile run and a workout where soldiers sprint, then drag a weighted sled and carry kettlebells. The new Army Fitness Test eliminates the standing power throw, an event sometimes called the ball yeet, which is widely disliked by service members; it requires soldiers to throw a 10-pound medicine ball backward over their heads. The biggest overall change will be in how the test is scored for 21 close combat occupations that are likely to be involved in heavy fighting in wartime: Women in those categories will be graded on the “male” scale, which is likely to significantly reduce the number of them who meet the requirements. For example, to pass the dead lift event, women ages 17 to 21 will need to lift at least 140 pounds, instead of the 120 required under the old standards. They will also have to run two miles in 22 minutes, instead of 23 minutes and 22 seconds. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington The culture wars returned to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, this time in a battle over whether public schools in Maryland must allow parents with religious objections to withdraw their children from classes in which storybooks with L.G.B.T.Q. themes are discussed. In a long, lively and sometimes heated argument that gave close consideration to a handful of books for young readers, questions from members of the court’s six-justice conservative majority indicated that the parents were very likely to prevail. “The plaintiffs here are not asking the school to change its curriculum,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said. “They’re just saying, ‘Look, we want out.’ Why isn’t that feasible? What is the big deal about allowing them to opt out of this?” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh noted that the school board had initially allowed parents to withdraw their children when the books were to be discussed but reversed course. “I’m not understanding why it’s not feasible,” he said, adding, “They’re not asking you to change what’s taught in the classroom.” Lawyers for the school system said the opt-outs were hard to administer, led to absenteeism and risked “exposing students who believe the storybooks represent them and their families to social stigma and isolation.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

On Tuesday, it gained its second high-profile contender, Representative Andy Barr.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The primary race in Kentucky for Mr. McConnell’s seat is expected to be one of the biggest G.O.P. clashes of 2026. On Tuesday, it gained its second high-profile contender, Representative Andy Barr. By Nick Corasaniti The race in Kentucky to succeed Senator Mitch McConnell, an omnipresent force in Republican politics for 40 years, is shaping up to be one of the biggest and most expensive G.O.P. clashes of 2026. Representative Andy Barr, a Republican who was first elected to Congress in 2012, announced on Tuesday that he was running for the seat that will be vacated by Mr. McConnell’s retirement. Mr. Barr’s candidacy sets up a Republican primary battle against Daniel Cameron, a former state attorney general and a protégé of Mr. McConnell’s. While Mr. Barr and Mr. Cameron are the only official G.O.P. candidates so far, several other well-known Kentucky Republicans, including Nate Morris, a wealthy businessman with ties to Vice President JD Vance and Donald Trump Jr., have indicated an interest in the seat. The Republican primary race will revolve around two party titans — President Trump and Mr. McConnell — whose approval among conservatives has sharply diverged. The candidates will feel compelled to demonstrate their pro-Trump credentials as they jockey for the president’s coveted endorsement. That battle is poised to lead to increased public criticism of Mr. McConnell, whose popularity among Republican voters has taken a nosedive. In a two-minute video on social media announcing his candidacy, Mr. Barr made no mention of Mr. McConnell but brought up Mr. Trump four times. “I’m running for Senate to help our president save this great country,” he says in the video. He later adds, “Working with President Trump, I’ll fight to create jobs for hardworking Kentuckians, instead of warm and fuzzies for hard-core liberals.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Helene Cooper and Eric Schmitt Details about American strikes in Yemen that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared on a commercial chat app came from U.S. Central Command through a secure, government system designed for sending classified information, according to an official and a person familiar with the conversations. The chats last month on the Signal app contained the times and sequencing for the launches of American fighter jets. A journalist as well as Mr. Hegseth’s wife, brother and personal lawyer were included in the chats. The Atlantic reported more than a month ago that its editor had been inadvertently included in one Signal chat group about the strikes before they took place. On Sunday, The New York Times reported that the defense secretary also revealed information about the Yemen strikes in a second group chat. Mr. Hegseth has not acknowledged any wrongdoing. transcript “We’re happy to be here at the Easter Egg Bowl, I’ll tell you that — A few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out. Hoaxsters. This group — no, no, no, — this group right here, full of hoaxsters that peddle anonymous sources from leakers with axes to grind, and then you put it all together as if it’s some news story. I’m going to go roll some Easter eggs with my kids.” “Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. Just the same old stuff from the media. That’s an old one. Try finding something new.” The Pentagon’s acting inspector general announced earlier this month that he would review Mr. Hegseth’s Yemen strike disclosures on Signal. Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican who chairs the Armed Services Committee, and the committee’s senior Democrat, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, requested the review. In a letter last month, the senators asked the inspector general to “conduct an inquiry” into whether Mr. Hegseth had shared sensitive or classified information in the first group chat.

"Harvard’s lawyers suggest the administration was sloppy when it froze billions in federal funding. A mundane but crucial law is essential to the university’s case against the government.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Harvard’s lawyers suggest the administration was sloppy when it froze billions in federal funding. A mundane but crucial law is essential to the university’s case against the government. By Alan Blinder and Michael C. Bender In the three months since President Trump returned to power, his administration has prized speed and shock value. Harvard University is wagering that White House strategy could be used against it. The 51-page lawsuit the university filed on Monday, intended to fight the administration’s freeze of billions in federal funding, hinges largely on a statute that provides specific timelines for federal agencies to draft rules and impose penalties. This wonky workhorse of American law, known as the Administrative Procedure Act, has been cited in a majority of lawsuits filed this year against the Trump administration, including complaints seeking to reverse funding reductions to the United States Agency for International Development, local schools and Voice of America. While Mr. Trump’s strategy has generated headlines, the outcomes of these cases will determine whether that approach will also produce lasting policy victories. In Harvard’s case, the university is seeking to fend off accusations of discrimination from the administration’s antisemitism task force, a group that was put together to move faster than typical federal civil rights investigators. The administration preferred to work with Harvard and encouraged the university to “come to the negotiating table in good faith” instead of grandstanding, said Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman. “Harvard is showboating,” Mr. Fields said. “But they know more than anyone that not playing ball is going to hurt their team. They need to be in compliance with federal law in order to get federal funds.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"The judge also ordered the government to halt its efforts to shut down two other government-funded outlets, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The judge also ordered the government to halt its efforts to shut down two other government-funded outlets, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. By Minho Kim Reporting from Washington A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from dismantling Voice of America, a government-funded news organization that President Trump has accused of being biased against him, and mandated that its journalists be allowed to resume their work. The judge, Royce C. Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, also ordered the administration to halt its effort to shut down two other federally funded outlets, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks. The judge’s carefully worded decision appeared aimed at closing loopholes in previous court rulings that allowed Trump officials to keep the Voice of America newsroom shuttered and its programming on hold. Voice of America, founded in 1942, had operated without interruption until March 15, a day after Mr. Trump signed an executive order seeking to gut its parent organization, the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Mr. Trump has attacked Voice of America as “the voice of radical America,” and accused the outlet, which delivers news to countries with limited press freedom — including Russia, China and Iran — of spreading “anti-American” and partisan “propaganda.” Kari Lake, a close ally of Mr. Trump whom he hired as special adviser to the media agency, declared the news outlet “unsalvageable.” She also claimed the media agency and its newsrooms were rampant with “waste, fraud and abuse,” without providing details on how taxpayer money was being misused. The executive order dismantling the outlet’s parent agency appeared to test the bounds of Mr. Trump’s authority, as Congress established it as independent and moved in 2020 to limit the power of its presidentially appointed leadership. Judge Lamberth is overseeing multiple court challenges to Mr. Trump’s order brought by Voice of America journalists and organizations that promote press freedoms abroad.

"Scott Bessent told a group of investors that he expected trade tensions with China to de-escalate.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by Scott Bessent told a group of investors that he expected trade tensions with China to de-escalate. By Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday that he thought an extension of President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts could be complete as soon as July 4 and that the administration would then shift its attention to deregulation. His comments, which were made during remarks at a private JP Morgan investor event, outlined how he expected Mr. Trump’s economic agenda to play out for the rest of the year. The comments came as policymakers around the world gathered in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank at a time of heightened anxiety over rising trade tension. The I.M.F. downgraded its outlook for growth globally and in the United States as a result of the tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on America’s trading partners. Mr. Bessent, who is negotiating trade deals with several countries, suggested that the uncertainty over trade could subside in the coming months and that the administration would be able to focus on other priorities. He has made the case that trade is just one part of an economic agenda that will stimulate economic growth and make the U.S. economy less reliant on government spending. The Treasury secretary said he believed that the House could pass tax legislation by Memorial Day and that the entire bill could be finalized by early July. “I’m optimistic, maybe we can have the tax bill done by 4th of July,” Mr. Bessent said, according to a person in the room who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a private event. “It’s sequencing, tariffs, tax bill — some certainty on that, then deregulation was always going to take longer.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The administration has said it would cut federal funds to states that allow trans girls and women to play on girls’ sports teams.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The administration has said it would cut federal funds to states that allow trans girls and women to play on girls’ sports teams. By Amy Harmon Minnesota became the first state on Tuesday to sue the Justice Department over its threats to cut federal funding to states that allow transgender girls and women to participate on sports teams that correspond with their gender identity. The lawsuit from Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s attorney general, said that two of President Trump’s executive orders and enforcement letters from the Justice Department violated state sovereignty rights under the 10th Amendment, usurped the power of Congress and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The Justice Department declined to comment. Last week, the Trump administration sued Maine over policies that allow some transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports, asserting that the state was violating a federal law intended to prevent discrimination based on sex. At a news conference announcing the move, Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested that the Justice Department was considering similar actions against Minnesota and California. The Trump administration has interpreted Title IX, a 1972 statute that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs that receive federal funding, to bar the participation of trans athletes on girls’ and women’s teams. One of Mr. Trump’s executive orders, titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,” directs the Department of Education to investigate schools that do not comply and to withdraw the schools’ federal funding. Mr. Trump’s order states that allowing transgender girls and women to compete in categories designated for female athletes is unfair and “results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls.” Another order directs every agency to ensure that federal funds are not used to promote what the administration calls gender ideology, a term that states that gender identity is an ideological movement. Mr. Ellison’s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, says that the Trump administration lacks the authority to impose its interpretation of Title IX on states through an executive order. The government cannot “terminate or withhold federal grants from Minnesota schools because the president has different policy preferences about how transgender athletes are allowed to compete in Minnesota,’’ the complaint says.

"President Trump’s recent comments blasting Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, for being “late” to lower interest rates had raised questions about his fate.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by President Trump’s recent comments blasting Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, for being “late” to lower interest rates had raised questions about his fate. By Colby Smith President Trump said on Tuesday that he had “no intention” of firing the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, even as he repeated his calls for the central bank to lower interest rates. The president made the remark during an event at the White House. The prospect that Mr. Trump would seek to infringe on the politically independent Fed had spooked financial markets in recent days, spurring an unsettling sell-off in stocks, government bonds and the dollar. Mr. Trump’s advisers have repeatedly told him that firing Mr. Powell is legally and financially fraught — and that the uncertainty could cause a significant downturn in financial markets. Mr. Trump, at least for the moment, has appeared persuaded, The New York Times reported last week. The president’s ire with Mr. Powell stems from his desire for the Fed to lower interest rates and the central bank’s hesitancy so far to do so. In a speech last week, Mr. Powell warned that Mr. Trump’s tariffs were poised to lift inflation and lower growth more than the central bank expected. His emphasis that the Fed had an “obligation” to make sure price pressures did not morph into a persistent inflation problem suggested the bar for the central bank to lower interest rates was high. Those comments set off a tirade from Mr. Trump, which included threats about the president’s ability to remove Mr. Powell. On Monday, Mr. Trump reiterated his calls for lower rates, saying that there was “virtually no inflation” in the United States and that costs for energy and “most other ‘things’” were falling. “With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,” Mr. Trump wrote on social media, referring to Mr. Powell. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump echoed that message, saying it was the “perfect time” for the Fed to take action. While Mr. Trump’s comments are certain to alleviate immediate concerns about Mr. Powell’s fate, his administration is currently testing its ability to challenge the legal safeguards that protect the Fed’s political independence. The Supreme Court is set to hear a case regarding the president’s ability to remove officials from independent agencies. Its ruling could have ramifications for the Fed. So far, Mr. Powell has staunchly defended his institution’s independence and has argued that it is a “matter of law.” Colby Smith covers the Federal Reserve and the U.S. economy for The Times.

"The Republican challenger has embarked on an extraordinary effort to reverse his election loss that critics say is testing the boundaries of post-election litigation.",2025-04-22,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The Republican challenger has embarked on an extraordinary effort to reverse his election loss that critics say is testing the boundaries of post-election litigation. By Eduardo Medina and Nick Corasaniti In North Carolina, the Republican candidate for a State Supreme Court seat has refused to concede to the Democratic incumbent, even though two recounts by a state elections board confirmed that he lost the November election by a few hundred votes. The Republican challenger, Judge Jefferson Griffin, who currently sits on the North Carolina Court of Appeals, has instead embarked on an extraordinary monthslong effort to toss out scores of ballots. The race is the last in the nation to be uncertified. Judge Griffin’s challenge has ping-ponged through federal and state courts. Most recently, the Democratic incumbent, Justice Allison Riggs, asked a federal court to overturn a State Supreme Court decision that could lead to thousands of military and overseas ballots being tossed. In late April, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit temporarily blocked the ballot verification process that had been ordered by the State Supreme Court. Many of the ballots in question come from Democratic-leaning counties, so their removal could lead to the election being overturned. As the case continues through the court system, Judge Griffin and the North Carolina Republican Party have drawn criticism from democracy watchdog groups, liberals and even some conservatives who worry about a dangerous precedent being set for future elections. Here’s what to know about the case. Justice Riggs was declared the winner of the State Supreme Court race last fall by 734 votes, an unusually small margin. Judge Griffin sought to verify that margin by requesting recounts. After the State Board of Elections reaffirmed Justice Riggs’s victory twice, Judge Griffin filed a protest with the board, which has a Democratic majority.

"A proposed reorganization of the State Department would eliminate an office whose official goal is to build “more democratic, secure, stable, and just societies.”",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by A proposed reorganization of the State Department would eliminate an office whose official goal is to build “more democratic, secure, stable, and just societies.” By Michael Crowley Michael Crowley covers diplomacy and the State Department. He reported from Washington. Human rights, democracy, refugees, war crimes. Those are some of the key responsibilities of a State Department office that Secretary of State Marco Rubio intends to shutter as part of a larger reorganization plan for his agency that he unveiled on Tuesday. The official goal of the office — the under secretary for civilian security, democracy and human rights — is to help countries “build more democratic, secure, stable, and just societies.” In a post on Substack on Tuesday, Mr. Rubio called the change a blow against rogue liberal bureaucrats, saying the office had become “a fertile environment for activists to redefine ‘human rights’ and ‘democracy’ and to pursue their projects at the taxpayer expense” even when they conflict with the president’s goals. The office’s nine bureaus will be pared down and in most cases merged into other parts of the department under Mr. Rubio’s plan. Bureaus slated for elimination include those focused on conflict, global criminal justice and combating antisemitism. Two of the bureaus, including a smaller democracy and human rights bureau, will continue to exist under a new Office of the Coordinator for Foreign Assistance and Humanitarian Affairs. But that office will no longer be led by an under secretary. On Tuesday, a State Department spokeswoman, Tammy Bruce, cautioned that the changes did not mean the end of values-based initiatives in U.S. foreign policy, arguing that the goal was a “nimbler” department.

By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Kim Severson Reporting from Washington Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. escalated his war against the food industry on Tuesday, declaring that “sugar is poison.” Mr. Kennedy’s comment came during a highly publicized news conference where he also asserted that he has “an understanding” with major food manufacturers to remove petroleum-based food colorings from their products by 2026. No one from the food industry attended the event, and none have publicly agreed to Mr. Kennedy’s demands, although the International Dairy Foods Association has pledged to eliminate artificial colors in milk, cheese and yogurt sold to schools as part of the federal lunch and breakfast programs by the start of the 2026 school year. However, Mr. Kennedy and his advisers said that every major food manufacturer and some fast-food companies have contacted the agency looking for guidance. “Four years from now, we are going to have most of these products off the market, or you will know about them when you go to the grocery store,” Mr. Kennedy said. Mr. Kennedy’s push to get food manufacturers to remove dyes from their products is his first effort at sweeping reform of the food industry, which he has long blamed for creating and marketing ultra-processed foods that he says are making Americans obese and contributing to a host of diseases, including diabetes and heart disease.

"Five Democrats met with Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk, who face deportation by the Trump administration.",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Five Democrats met with Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk, who face deportation by the Trump administration. By Michael Gold Reporting from Washington Five congressional Democrats on Tuesday traveled to Louisiana, where they met with two graduate students who have been detained by federal immigration officials and have become high-profile examples of the Trump administration’s efforts to suppress pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses. The lawmakers’ trip was an effort to bring further attention to the cases of Rumeysa Ozturk, a doctoral student at Tufts University in Massachusetts, and Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate student at Columbia University in New York, who were detained under a rarely used legal provision that allows the secretary of state to deport noncitizens deemed a threat to American foreign policy. The students’ lawyers have argued that their detentions violate their rights to free speech. The visit to Louisiana was the latest attempt by Democrats to use the congressional recess to draw attention to what they see as violations of due process during President Trump’s second term. Over the last week, Democrats have made two visits to El Salvador to highlight the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man whom Trump administration officials have admitted to erroneously deporting. In Louisiana, Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Representatives Jim McGovern and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Troy Carter of Louisiana and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi met with Mr. Khalil and Ms. Ozturk and toured the facilities where they were detained. Both had been transferred hundreds of miles away from their homes and from where they were originally detained. In a news conference outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Basile, La., where Ms. Ozturk is being held, the lawmakers argued that the government had violated the students’ constitutional rights and that both had been targeted for their political views. “Neither of them committed any crimes,” Mr. McGovern said. “They’ve been charged with nothing.” Mr. Markey criticized immigration officials for sending the two students to facilities in Louisiana, arguing the government did so to secure a more favorable hearing for their deportation proceedings.

"The president claimed that countries were sending their prisoners to the United States and that he needed to bypass the constitutional demands of due process to expel them quickly.",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The president claimed that countries were sending their prisoners to the United States and that he needed to bypass the constitutional demands of due process to expel them quickly. By Luke Broadwater Reporting from the White House President Trump asserted on Tuesday that undocumented immigrants should not be entitled to trials, insisting that his administration should be able to deport them without appearing before a judge. The remarks, which he made in the Oval Office in front of reporters, were Mr. Trump’s latest broadside against the judiciary, which he has said is inhibiting his deportation powers. Mr. Trump falsely claimed that countries like Congo and Venezuela had emptied their prisons into the United States and that he therefore needed to bypass the constitutional demands of due process to expel the immigrants quickly. “I hope we get cooperation from the courts, because we have thousands of people that are ready to go out and you can’t have a trial for all of these people,” Mr. Trump said. “It wasn’t meant. The system wasn’t meant. And we don’t think there’s anything that says that.” He claimed that the “very bad people” he was removing from the country included killers, drug dealers and the mentally ill. “We’re getting them out, and a judge can’t say, ‘No, you have to have a trial,’” Mr. Trump said. “The trial is going to take two years. We’re going to have a very dangerous country if we’re not allowed to do what we’re entitled to do.” He made similar statements in a social media post on Monday in which he wrote, “We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years.” Mr. Trump’s remarks have drawn swift backlash. Representative Jonathan L. Jackson, Democrat of Illinois, wrote on social media: “‘We can’t give everyone a trial' — excuse me, what?! That’s straight-up #dictator talk. Due process isn’t optional because it’s inconvenient. This is the United States, not a banana republic. If you want to shred the Constitution, just say so.” Mr. Trump’s comments came after the Supreme Court, early on Saturday, temporarily blocked the administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants it accused of being gang members under the expansive powers of a rarely invoked wartime law. Mr. Trump issued a proclamation last month invoking the Alien Enemies Act as a way to deport immigrants he alleged were members of Tren de Aragua, a violent Venezuelan street gang. The law, which was passed in 1798, has been used only three times before in U.S. history, during periods of declared war. The Supreme Court has ruled that those subject to the statute needed to be given the opportunity to challenge their removal. The Trump administration has also been dogged by the case of a Salvadoran man living in Maryland who was deported because of an “administrative error.” The Supreme Court ordered the administration nearly two weeks ago to facilitate his return so he could go through the legal system in the United States, but the White House has so far not fulfilled that order. The White House posted on social media that the man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was “never coming back.” Luke Broadwater covers the White House for The Times.

For the foreseeable future, a school that burned during the fires in Los Angeles this year will call a retrofitted Sears home. Students and teachers at Palisades Charter High School have met online since a wildfire swept through Pacific Palisades in January and decimated their school building and many of their homes. On Tuesday, they gathered in person at their school’s temporary new home in nearby Santa Monica, where they hugged, cried and navigated classrooms set up inside the former department store. “After everything we’ve been through — now we have a place to be all of a sudden,” Charlie Speiser, a junior, said. He had commuted over an hour from Hermosa Beach, where his family is living after having lost their home in the fire. The new facility, located on the busy southern edge of Downtown Santa Monica, is called “Pali South.” It will serve students for the remainder of the school year, and potentially well into the next, depending on the speed of recovery at their Palisades campus. About 40 percent of the campus was destroyed in the fire. The building is a local landmark — a 1947 design by the architect Rowland Crawford, with grooved ivory and green walls. A large blue Pali High sign now replaces what was a neon green Sears sign above the entrance. Inside, 90 classrooms, a few offices and some communal areas have been constructed using a $10 million insurance payment, as well as donations and school funds. Teachers tried to find ways to make the new building feel more like their old school. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"The jails of Riverside County are plagued with unusually high murder rates and recurring security failures by an inexperienced staff.",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The jails of Riverside County are plagued with unusually high murder rates and recurring security failures by an inexperienced staff. By Christopher Damien Christopher Damien reported about law enforcement in Southern California’s inland and desert communities as part of The Times’s Local Investigations Fellowship. As two cellmates were fighting in a Riverside County, Calif., jail, an inexperienced guard remotely opened the cell door, a violation of safety protocols. One of the men immediately pulled out the other, hoisted him over his shoulder and threw him over a catwalk railing. He fell 15 feet before smashing into a metal table. It was his first day in the jail and his last day of life. At another county jail, a detainee who had been mentally ill and charged with child sexual abuse should have been segregated for his own safety. Instead, he was placed in a bunk room with about 15 other men where he was strangled. When a guard started a security check more than 90 minutes late at another county site, blood was pooling under a cell door and a detainee was wiping the walls. Inside, the officer found the man’s cellmate beaten, stabbed and without a pulse. Killings are relatively rare in American jails, but those in Riverside County experienced a surge in them. They had the highest homicide rate among large jails in California from 2020 through 2023, according to state data. The murders and other deaths made the county’s five jails the second-deadliest in the nation during that period. In 2022, the jail system’s worst year, 19 detainees would die from homicides, suicides, overdoses and natural causes. There were clear patterns of security lapses, negligence and policy violations that contributed to the six homicides in the county jails from 2020 through last year, The New York Times and The Desert Sun found. Similar issues were factors in the other deaths from this time period, previous reporting shows. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Then another and another and another, until residents of one New England enclave said that the number had reached at least 20. The culprit apparently did not believe that it was bad luck to break mirrors — and still doesn’t. Janelle Favaloro, 59, who has lived in the Squam Hill section of Rockport, Mass., for 36 years, put out an A.P.B. on Facebook for the menace. “We have a vandal in the neighborhood,” Ms. Favaloro wrote. “He was described as 18 to 24 inches tall, wearing black and white with a red hat.” The brazen suspect, who would become known to many in the neighborhood, was actually a pileated woodpecker, one of the largest forest bird species on the continent. The male bird was marking his turf during mating season, which may explain some of the aggression. Residents recognized the bird by the distinctive red malar stripe along its cheekbone area, as well as by its size. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The president said he has “no intention” of ousting Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, but the administration’s willingness to challenge norms regarding the central bank’s political independence is causing concern.",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The president said he has “no intention” of ousting Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, but the administration’s willingness to challenge norms regarding the central bank’s political independence is causing concern. By Colby Smith In his first term, President Trump toyed with ousting Jerome H. Powell out of anger that the Federal Reserve chair was moving too slowly to cut interest rates. Mr. Trump refrained from doing so, but continued to publicly attack Mr. Powell and his colleagues for keeping borrowing costs too high. The Fed ultimately did cut rates but not because of Mr. Trump’s jawboning. The president’s trade war with China risked roiling the U.S. economy so significantly that the Fed moved pre-emptively in 2019 to stave off a painful downturn. There was little downside to doing so: Inflation was not remotely a concern at the time, giving officials the flexibility to eventually reduce rates three times. Now back in office, Mr. Trump has again begun berating Mr. Powell and the Fed, urging them to lower borrowing costs. But the economic circumstances today are drastically different from those of 2019, setting the stage for a more intense showdown between the central bank and Mr. Trump. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he had “no intention” of firing Mr. Powell despite having lambasted him over several days, calling the Fed chair a “major loser” and saying his “termination cannot come fast enough!” But the clash between Mr. Trump and the Fed is likely to linger. On one side is a Fed now much more hesitant to reduce borrowing costs because of fears that the broad-based tariffs Mr. Trump has announced on virtually all U.S. trading partners will reignite inflation and slow economic growth. On the other side is a White House wanting immediate relief and taking steps to infringe on the central bank’s longstanding political independence. “This is an existentially threatening moment for the institution,” said David Wilcox, who is a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the director of U.S. economic research at Bloomberg Economics and a former leader of the Fed’s research and statistics division. “We may be on the cusp of throwing away an asset that has taken decades to accumulate.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Perkins Coie and WilmerHale asked two federal judges on Wednesday to permanently put an end to President Trump’s threats to their businesses.",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Perkins Coie and WilmerHale asked two federal judges on Wednesday to permanently put an end to President Trump’s threats to their businesses. By Zach Montague Reporting from Washington Two federal judges on Wednesday appeared sympathetic to arguments from elite law firms asking for definitive relief from President Trump’s executive orders targeting them. Lawyers for two firms, Perkins Coie and WilmerHale, have asked the courts to permanently block the Trump administration from carrying out the orders, arguing that the measures are so blatantly unconstitutional that no trial is necessary. The orders, they stressed, pose a critical threat to their businesses and the legal profession writ large. The firms have clients and have employed lawyers Mr. Trump opposes politically. The judges presiding over their cases, Beryl A. Howell and Richard J. Leon of the Federal District Court in Washington, said they would take some time to reach a final decision. But both appeared receptive to the firms’ position that Mr. Trump was retaliating against them for speech he does not like. Mr. Trump singled out Perkins Coie and WilmerHale for punishment in March with individualized executive orders, owing largely to past legal work on behalf of clients opposing Mr. Trump and policies he had championed. Among other measures, the orders directed federal agencies not to contract with the firms or permit their staff into federal buildings, and to suspend security clearances held by their lawyers. Both firms had been involved in investigations concerning Russian disinformation during the 2016 election, and the question of whether Russian influence had been designed to benefit Mr. Trump’s campaign. And both noted in court filings that the president himself had said repeatedly that he had singled them out specifically because of their previous clients.

"It has been a rough patch for Mr. Musk, but he is about to realize a dream for SpaceX, its employees and for himself, his own town on the southern tip of Texas.",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by It has been a rough patch for Mr. Musk, but he is about to realize a dream for SpaceX, its employees and for himself, his own town on the southern tip of Texas. By J. David Goodman Reporting from what is likely very soon to be the city of Starbase, Texas A lone banner along State Highway 4 announced the location on Tuesday of the only voting center in what is sure to be a newly incorporated town arising on a spit of land at the southern tip of Texas. On the ballot: A measure to formally launch Starbase, Texas, the town long dreamed of by Elon Musk to be home to his rocket company, SpaceX, and its 3,500 employees. Voting was taking place, appropriately enough, at a SpaceX building usually closed to visitors. It has been a tough few weeks for Mr. Musk. Tesla announced on Tuesday its profits fell 71 percent in the first three months of the year. The company’s stock price has been plunging, denting Mr. Musk’s still-fabulous wealth. His work slashing the federal government has made him reviled in many parts of the country. He has publicly tussled with other advisers at the Trump White House, where he has ensconced himself. But the Starbase vote is a bright spot for the megabillionaire. A little more than four years ago, Mr. Musk began publicly suggesting a fanciful new name for the stretch of coastal wetlands where SpaceX builds and launches its rockets. For a while, it seemed like just calling it Starbase would be enough. But as the company grew its footprint, moving its corporate headquarters and feverishly building housing to keep up with its swelling work force, the boss wanted a real town. With voting now underway, that reality could be declared on May 3, Election Day, when voting ends. Only a few dozen voters came out on the first day of early voting. There were, after all, just 279 people eligible to cast a ballot, 90 percent of whom have flocked to the area and registered since the start of 2024, according to county records obtained by The New York Times in a public information act request. The proposed city, at about 1.5 square miles, or a little larger than Central Park, would be populated almost exclusively by employees of SpaceX and their relatives. Voting concludes on May 3. But small as the town may be, Mr. Musk wanted it. And the denizens were no doubt going to oblige, even if they didn’t much want to talk about it. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat for two decades and a leading liberal voice on Capitol Hill, announced on Wednesday that he would not seek re-election next year, closing out a 44-year congressional career focused on immigration, the federal justice system and anti-smoking initiatives. The decision by Mr. Durbin, 80, was widely expected and will immediately touch off a crowded competition for a rare Senate vacancy in his solidly blue state. It also intensifies a generational shift in the chamber as he becomes the fifth sitting senator to announce a retirement, all of them over the age of 65. In an interview ahead of his announcement, Mr. Durbin, who is in his fifth Senate term, said it was not an easy choice to step away from his prime perch doing battle with President Trump, whom he considers a dire threat to democracy. He described moments in recent days “where I thought, ‘Man, I don’t want to miss this fight.’” “But you know,” he continued, “I have to be honest about this. There are good people in the wings, good people on the bench ready to serve, and they can fight this fight just as effectively as I can. There comes a point where you have to face reality that this is the time to leave for me.” “In my heart,” the senator said in a video announcing his decision, “I know it’s time to pass the torch.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The British entrepreneur said the U.S. government’s unpredictable tariffs had “financially done a lot of harm” and driven the world to “the verge of a complete meltdown two weeks ago.”",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The British entrepreneur said the U.S. government’s unpredictable tariffs had “financially done a lot of harm” and driven the world to “the verge of a complete meltdown two weeks ago.” By Stephen Castle Reporting from London Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Atlantic, sharply criticized President Trump’s “erratic” trade policies on Wednesday, saying that they risk “doing so much damage around the world” and that most Americans do not support them. “The unpredictability is just awful for everybody around the world,” Mr. Branson told reporters from British news outlets during a business trip to Saudi Arabia. “It’s just erratic, unpredictable, which is very, very difficult for business to deal with.” He added: “An unsettled world is not good for anybody. People delay decisions on investment and spending.” Mr. Branson’s comments were striking because many business leaders have avoided direct public criticism of Mr. Trump, apparently for fear of antagonizing his administration. By contrast, Mr. Branson directly spoke out against the president’s policy of imposing heavy tariffs on most imports to the United States, even on goods coming from close allies. He also said Mr. Trump’s decision to essentially switch sides on the Ukraine war — by warming up to Moscow while pushing Ukraine to accept the loss of territory — “had put America on the wrong side of history” and “should worry the world the most.” Mr. Branson, one of Britain’s best known business figures, spoke while visiting Riyadh to launch a Virgin Atlantic flight from Heathrow Airport in London to the Saudi capital. His comments were quoted by several outlets, including The Telegraph, The Times of London and the Financial Times. The U.S. government’s tariff announcements had, Mr. Branson said, “financially done a lot of harm. The world was on the verge of a complete meltdown two weeks ago.” The British entrepreneur said that he believed the president’s policy agenda was promoted by “a fairly small elite of people around Trump” but lacked the support of many Americans. “I don’t think he’s carrying the vast majority of Americans in what he’s doing,” Mr. Branson said. “Most American people are decent individuals. I’m just sad, incredibly sad. And many, many, many Americans I know are just very sad.” Stephen Castle is a London correspondent of The Times, writing widely about Britain, its politics and the country’s relationship with Europe.

"An Indonesian man with a student visa and an American wife thought he would soon get a green card.

Now, he could get deported over a 2022 arrest. By Ernesto Londoño Reporting from St. Paul, Minn. Recent videos on social media showing immigration agents taking people into custody unnerved Aditya Harsono, who had himself come to this country from Indonesia on a student visa. But he said he presumed that the media was probably exaggerating the extent of the Trump administration’s actions. His understanding shifted in late March, though, when a supervisor at the hospital where he was working in western Minnesota summoned him downstairs, and two federal agents put him in handcuffs. “Everything kind of shattered,” said Mr. Harsono, who learned that his student visa, which had allowed him to earn a master’s degree in business administration and to then stay for a year to work, had been revoked because of a misdemeanor property destruction conviction. Mr. Harsono, who is married to an American citizen and has applied for a green card, has been held in a county jail since and faces deportation. The Trump administration’s decision to revoke more than 1,500 student visas in recent weeks has raised concern at college campuses across the country. The people affected include students involved in activism over the war in Gaza, whom the Trump administration has characterized as disruptive. Some others, including Mr. Harsono, appear to have lost their visas as a result of criminal convictions, some for relatively minor offenses. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Residents of a Chicago suburb described their memories of the day and its lasting effects on their lives during a sentencing hearing for the man responsible. He was absent.",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Residents of a Chicago suburb described their memories of the day and its lasting effects on their lives during a sentencing hearing for the man responsible. He was absent. By Julie Bosman Reporting from Waukegan, Ill. It began just like every other Fourth of July parade, the witnesses said on Wednesday. In a small courtroom in Lake County, Ill., they recalled the details of the day nearly three years ago with quiet clarity: the high school marching band strolling through downtown Highland Park, the families gathered in their usual spots along the parade route, the police officers directing traffic. And then, witnesses recalled, they heard a popping sound, over and over, coming from a rooftop. “It went from watching a parade to utter chaos,” said Dana Ruder Ring, a Highland Park resident who testified that she grabbed her children and ran for their lives when she and her husband realized that a shooting was unfolding. There will be no trial for the shooter, Robert Crimo III, who pleaded guilty in March to 69 criminal counts, including murder and attempted murder, in the deaths of the seven people on July 4, 2022. The authorities said that Mr. Crimo, then 21, had climbed onto a rooftop in Highland Park, a suburb north of Chicago, and fired into the crowd below with a high-powered rifle. He fled in the aftermath but was arrested in a nearby town hours later. Instead, Wednesday was the start of Mr. Crimo’s sentencing hearing, one that could stretch for two or more days so that witnesses and victims can tell their stories. No sentence has been decided yet. Using photos, videos and drone footage, prosecutors established how Mr. Crimo committed the crime, how law enforcement officers responded and how the Highland Park residents who witnessed the shootings still feel the anguish. Family members of those killed packed the courtroom, watching testimony intently and occasionally dabbing away tears. They did not have the opportunity to address Mr. Crimo directly, since he remained in the Lake County jail and did not attend the sentencing hearing. His lawyers noted his absence and said that he did not wish to attend. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

By Michael Levenson A Southern California judge was convicted on Tuesday of second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of his wife in August 2023 after what prosecutors described as a “drunken argument over money.” The judge, Jeffrey Ferguson of Orange County Superior Court, 74, faces 40 years to life in prison at his sentencing on June 13, according to the Orange County District Attorney’s Office. Prosecutors said that on Aug. 3, 2023, Judge Ferguson shot his wife, Sheryl Ferguson, 65, at their home in Anaheim Hills, Calif., southeast of Los Angeles. Prosecutors said that the judge pulled a pistol from an ankle holster and shot Ms. Ferguson once in the chest at close range as they watched television in the living room. The judge then went outside, prosecutors said, and texted his court bailiff and clerk. “I just lost it,” he wrote. “I just shot my wife. I won’t be in tomorrow. I will be in custody. I’m so sorry.” The judge’s son, who was with them that night, called 911 to report that his mother had been shot after she told her husband, “Why don’t you point a real gun at me?” prosecutors said.

"President Trump’s approval rating has sunk to about 45 percent, down from 52 percent one week after he took office.",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by President Trump’s approval rating has sunk to about 45 percent, down from 52 percent one week after he took office. The New York Times By Tyler Pager and Ruth Igielnik Reporting from Washington [See the latest polling average of the president’s job approval and results of a Times/Siena poll on the president’s first 100 days in office.] President Trump’s job approval rating has fallen steadily during his first three months in office, according to a New York Times average of polling. Mr. Trump’s approval rating has sunk to about 45 percent, down from 52 percent one week after he took office. Around half of the country now disapproves of his performance, the polling shows. American presidents typically enter office with a groundswell of support that wanes over time. But Mr. Trump’s approval has been dropping slightly faster than that of his predecessors. Mr. Trump started his term with the second-lowest approval rating for a president in modern history. The only recent president to have started in a worse position was Mr. Trump the first time he took office. The polling average, assembled by The New York Times, includes nearly all publicly released polls that track Mr. Trump’s approval rating. The goal of a polling average is to balance the biases of individual polls, which can vary in quality and frequency, and to make it easier to track changes in public opinion over time.

"White House officials are eschewing normal legal processes as they rush to ramp up deportations, saying there is no time to afford unauthorized immigrants any rights — and that they don’t deserve them anyway.",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by News Analysis White House officials are eschewing normal legal processes as they rush to ramp up deportations, saying there is no time to afford unauthorized immigrants any rights — and that they don’t deserve them anyway. By Luke Broadwater Reporting from Washington While the Justice Department argues in court that it is working to comply with judges’ orders to provide migrants with due process before deporting them, President Trump and his top advisers are increasingly making a different argument altogether: Why should we? In their rapid, maximalist campaign to apprehend and deport as many migrants as possible as quickly as possible, Mr. Trump and top members of his administration have abandoned any pretense of being bound by the constitutional limits that have constrained presidents of both parties in the past on immigration. Instead, they are asserting that when it comes to people who entered the United States illegally, the president has unchecked power to expel them without recourse, and that he has neither the time nor the obligation to do otherwise. “We’re getting them out, and a judge can’t say, ‘No, you have to have a trial,’” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday in the Oval Office. “The trial is going to take two years. We’re going to have a very dangerous country if we’re not allowed to do what we’re entitled to do.” He made similar remarks on social media on Monday, writing: “We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years.” Such statements are alarming to legal experts who note that in the United States civil rights are for everyone — not just citizens. “It’s enormously disturbing,” said Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley. “It is so troubling to hear the president and top executive officials give so little regard to the Constitution. It’s important to emphasize that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment says no person can be ‘deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.’ It doesn’t say ‘citizen.’” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Blue Elizabeth Dias reported from the check-in counter for ITA Airways, the security line, the Lufthansa lounge and Gate 4 in Terminal 1 at Kennedy International Airport. The police lined the departures curb, eyes peeled for the cardinal arriving any moment at Terminal 1 at Kennedy International Airport. It was 6:32 p.m. on Tuesday, about 39 hours after the death of Pope Francis had been announced. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York was booked on AZ611, the 9:10 p.m. ITA Airways nonstop flight to Fiumicino Airport in Rome, departing Gate 4. “How’s my buddy!” he said, smiling as he stepped out of a Toyota Sienna’s passenger seat, greeting the closest police officer. Aides juggled the bags, unloading them from the trunk. Of the 10 American cardinals who are part of the body that will elect the next pope, Cardinal Dolan was among the first to make his way to Rome. In Washington, Cardinals Robert W. McElroy and Wilton Gregory would be leaving soon, as would Cardinal Blase Cupich in Chicago. Passengers glanced at the hubbub surrounding the man in the black suit, Roman collar and a large metal cross as he was ushered to a special check-in counter inside. For his regular trips to Rome, Cardinal Dolan doesn’t check any bags. But this time, he expected to be there for several weeks — through the funeral, conclave and installation of the next pope. He fiddled with a Vatican tag on the handle of a suitcase. “I didn’t realize this!” he said. “This is from the conclave in 2013!

"DOGE once demanded that federal employees list five accomplishments each week. Here are Elon Musk’s from his time in Washington.",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Newsletter DOGE once demanded that federal employees list five accomplishments each week. Here are Elon Musk’s from his time in Washington. By Lisa Lerer Elon Musk announced yesterday that he was stepping back from his work at the Department of Government Efficiency to focus more on his companies, particularly Tesla. Given that his intense focus on Washington appears to be abating, if not concluding, I thought it might be a good time to assess what, exactly, he has achieved there so far. And what better way to grade him than using the same method with which he sought to evaluate thousands of government workers? Back in February, DOGE demanded that federal employees send an email each week listing five bullet points of their accomplishments. So, here are five bullet points on what Musk achieved in Washington: He tanked his company. Tesla’s profits plummeted by 71 percent from last year, the company reported on Tuesday. And even as sales of electric vehicles rose globally, Tesla sales have slumped because of competition from Chinese carmakers and Mr. Musk’s support for right-wing causes. On a call with investors on Tuesday, Musk attributed the decline to “those receiving the waste and fraud” from the government. “The protests that you’ll see out there, they’re very organized. They’re paid for,” he said, providing no evidence for his claim. He became unpopular. Polling shows that Musk’s approval ratings have taken a nosedive since he came to Washington, largely driven by disapproval among Democratic and independent voters. In a Marquette University poll this month, 38 percent of Americans said they had a favorable view of Musk, compared with 60 percent who viewed him unfavorably. He cut some government spending, but we don’t really know how much. Musk arrived in Washington with promises to cut $1 trillion from the next fiscal year’s federal budget. On a website tracking its progress, DOGE put the savings at $160 billion. But as my colleagues have reported, that estimate might be inflated. The group’s accounting has been riddled with billion-dollar errors and it has claimed to have cut spending that was never even scheduled for this year. He became the country’s biggest political donor. An analysis released last month found that Musk had donated more than $291 million to Republican candidates, political action committees and other conservative organizations during the 2024 race. That’s nearly $95 million more than the next largest Republican contributor and more than four times more than the largest donor to Democratic candidates. Since the election, he has shown no sign of halting his involvement in electoral politics. Musk and allied groups spent more than $20 million on a Wisconsin state Supreme Court contest, transforming the race into a referendum on him — and he lost. And he has threatened primary challenges against any Republican House member who does not support President Trump’s agenda. He scooped up a ton of personal data. Through his executive order creating DOGE, Trump granted Musk’s group access to “all unclassified agency records” — a category that includes sensitive information on virtually everyone in America. A recent Times investigation found that Musk’s team has tried to access databases that track more than 300 separate pieces of data, including not just Social Security numbers but immigration status, gambling income, student loan balances and even professional job references. We don’t know precisely what data the DOGE team has about you, but it could be quite a lot. BY THE NUMBERS The idea underpinning the Department of Government Efficiency — that the government is wasteful and inefficient — is a view most Americans have held for decades, according to surveys. And Americans mostly support the concept of DOGE when asked about it directly. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"President Trump has said his punishing tariffs would force companies to build factories in the United States. But it is far from clear that they will have the effects he predicted.",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by President Trump has said his punishing tariffs would force companies to build factories in the United States. But it is far from clear that they will have the effects he predicted. By David E. Sanger David E. Sanger has covered six presidencies in four decades at The Times, where he writes often on the revival of superpower conflict. After weeks of bluster and escalation, President Trump blinked. Then he blinked again. And again. He backed off his threat to fire the Federal Reserve chairman. His Treasury secretary, acutely aware that the S&P 500 was down 10 percent since Mr. Trump was inaugurated, signaled he was looking for an offramp to avoid an intensifying trade war with China. And now Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the 145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods that he announced just two weeks ago are not sustainable. He was prompted in part by the warnings of senior executives from Target and Walmart and other large American retailers that consumers would see price surges and empty shelves for some imported goods within a few weeks. Mr. Trump’s encounter with reality amounted to a vivid case study in the political and economic costs of striking the hardest of hard lines. He entered this trade war imagining a simpler era in which imposing punishing tariffs would force companies around the world to build factories in the United States. He ends the month discovering that the world of modern supply chains is far more complex than he bargained for, and that it is far from clear his “beautiful” tariffs will have the effects he predicted. This is not, of course, the explanation of the events of the past few days that the White House is putting out. Mr. Trump’s aides insist that his maximalist demands have been an act of strategic brilliance, forcing 90 countries to line up to deal with the president. It may take months, they acknowledge, to see the concessions that will result. But bending the global trade system to American will, they say, takes time. “Have some patience and you will see,” the president’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters on Wednesday.

"It was the latest move by President Trump in his effort to shift the ideological tilt of the higher education system as he battles elite universities.",2025-04-23,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by It was the latest move by President Trump in his effort to shift the ideological tilt of the higher education system as he battles elite universities. By Michael C. Bender Reporting from Washington President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order targeting college accreditors, a group of largely unknown but long-established companies that evaluate the educational quality and financial health of universities. The order, one of seven education-related measures he signed on Wednesday, was the latest move by Mr. Trump aimed at shifting the ideological tilt of the higher education system, which he views as hostile to conservatives. His administration has escalated its fight with elite universities in recent weeks, demanding significant changes to hiring, admissions and curriculum practices. At least one, Harvard, has chosen to fight back, setting up a billion-dollar battle for academic independence. A passing grade from accreditation companies, some of which have existed for more than a century, is crucial for colleges to gain access to $120 billion in federal financial aid approved each year. But Mr. Trump has blamed these businesses for promoting the kind of diversity, equity and inclusion policies that his administration has made a priority to stamp out. During his last presidential campaign, Mr. Trump did not speak often about accreditors, which have long been a target of conservative Republicans. But when he did, he reserved some of his most biting attacks for them. In a policy video he posted in the summer of 2023, he vowed to take aim at “radical left accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs and lunatics.” Mr. Trump’s order would make it easier for schools to switch accreditors and for new accreditors to gain federal approval, according to the White House, which provided fact sheets about the measures. The text of the orders was not immediately available. Bob Shireman, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a liberal think tank that studies college accreditation policy, among other things, said that Mr. Trump’s order would undermine institutional independence, which, he said, “has helped our universities to be the best in the world.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Jonathan SwanMaggie HabermanNicholas NehamasTheodore Schleifer and David A. Fahrenthold Jonathan Swan, Nicholas Nehamas, Theodore Schleifer and David A. Fahrenthold reported from Washington. Maggie Haberman reported from New York. As Elon Musk sought to reassure Wall Street analysts on Tuesday that he would soon scale back his work with the federal government, the strain of his situation was audible in his voice. The world’s richest man said that he would continue arguing that the Trump administration should lower tariffs it has imposed on countries across the world. But he acknowledged in a subdued voice that whether President Trump “will listen to my advice is up to him.” He was not quite chastened, but it was a different Mr. Musk than a couple months ago, when the billionaire, at the peak of his power, brandished a chain saw onstage at a pro-Trump conference to dramatize his role as a government slasher. Back then, Mr. Musk was inarguably a force in Washington, driving radical change across the government. To the president, he was a genius; to Democrats, he was Mr. Trump’s “unelected co-president”; to several cabinet secretaries, he was a menace; and to G.O.P. lawmakers, he was the source of anguished calls from constituents whose services and jobs were threatened by cuts from his Department of Government Efficiency. As Mr. Musk moves to spend less time in Washington, it is unclear whether his audacious plan to overhaul the federal bureaucracy will have lasting power. The endeavor has already left an immense imprint on the government, and Mr. Musk has told associates that he believes he has put in place the structure to make DOGE a success. But he has still not come close to cutting the $1 trillion he vowed to find in waste, fraud and abuse. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The lawsuit, filed by Democratic attorneys general, said the president’s tariffs have hurt their economies and residents.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The lawsuit, filed by Democratic attorneys general, said the president’s tariffs have hurt their economies and residents. By David W. Chen A dozen states, most of them led by Democrats, sued President Trump over his tariffs on Wednesday, arguing that he has no power to “arbitrarily impose tariffs as he has done here.” Contending that only Congress has the power to legislate tariffs, the states are asking the court to block the Trump administration from enforcing what they said were unlawful tariffs. “These edicts reflect a national trade policy that now hinges on the president’s whims rather than the sound exercise of his lawful authority,” said the lawsuit, filed by the states’ attorneys general in the U.S. Court of International Trade. The states, including New York, Illinois and Oregon, are the latest parties to take the Trump administration to court over the tariffs. Their case comes after California filed its own lawsuit last week, in which Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state attorney general accused the administration of escalating a trade war that has caused “immediate and irreparable harm” to that state’s economy. Officials and businesses from Oregon, the lead plaintiff in the suit filed Wednesday, have also expressed concerns about the vulnerability of the state’s trade-dependent economy, as well as its sportswear industry, as a result of the tariffs. “When a president pushes an unlawful policy that drives up prices at the grocery store and spikes utility bills, we don’t have the luxury of standing by,” said Dan Rayfield, Oregon’s attorney general, in a statement. “These tariffs hit every corner of our lives — from the checkout line to the doctor’s office — and we have a responsibility to push back.” Asked about the latest lawsuit, Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, called it a “witch hunt” by Democrats against Mr. Trump. “The Trump administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing,” he said, “both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit.”  The other states in the suit are Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico and Vermont. All of the states have Democratic attorneys general, though Nevada and Vermont have Republican governors. Mr. Trump’s tariffs have shocked and upended the global trade industry. He set a 145 percent tariff on goods from China, 25 percent on Canada, and 10 percent on almost all imports from most other countries. The moves have drawn legal challenges from other entities as well, including two members of the Blackfeet Nation, who filed a federal lawsuit in Montana over the tariffs on Canada, saying they violated tribal treaty rights. Legal groups like the Liberty Justice Center and the New Civil Liberties Alliance have also sued. “I’m happy that Oregon and the other states are joining us in this fight,” said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, who is working on the Liberty Justice Center’s lawsuit. David W. Chen reports on state legislatures, state level policymaking and the political forces behind them.

"Korbein Schultz, 25, who was an intelligence analyst, accepted $42,000 in bribes for sensitive documents, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty in 2024.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Korbein Schultz, 25, who was an intelligence analyst, accepted $42,000 in bribes for sensitive documents, prosecutors said. He pleaded guilty in 2024. By Neil Vigdor A former U.S. Army intelligence analyst with top secret security clearance was sentenced to seven years in prison on Wednesday for selling classified military information to a foreign national who was most likely connected to the Chinese government, federal prosecutors said. The analyst, Sgt. Korbein Schultz, 25, sent at least 92 sensitive documents to a conspirator, who was not named, in a period of less than two years, the authorities said. The material included technical manuals for intercontinental ballistic missile systems and information on Chinese military tactics, they said. Mr. Schultz, of Wills Point, Texas, received $42,000 in exchange for the information, according to the Justice Department. He pleaded guilty last August to six criminal counts that included conspiracy to obtain and transmit national defense data, bribery of a public official and exporting technical defense data. The counts all together could have brought a sentence of up to 65 years in prison. Mr. Schultz will also be required to complete three years of supervised release as part of his sentence, which was handed down in federal court in Nashville. “Protecting classified information is paramount to our national security, and this sentencing reflects the ramifications when there is a breach of that trust,” Brig. Gen. Rhett R. Cox, the commanding general of the Army Counterintelligence Command, said in a statement on Wednesday. “This soldier’s actions put Army personnel at risk, placing individual gain above personal honor.” Mary Kathryn Harcombe, a federal public defender who represented Mr. Schultz, declined to comment on the sentence. Mr. Schultz, who was assigned to the 506th Infantry Battalion, was arrested in March 2024 at Fort Campbell in Kentucky. Prosecutors said that he had shared his Army unit’s operational order with the conspirator before the unit was deployed to Eastern Europe to support NATO operations. The conspirator contacted him shortly after he had received his top secret security clearance, they said. He also supplied the person with details on U.S. military exercises in South Korea and the Philippines, in addition to lessons learned by the U.S. Army from the Ukraine-Russia war that are applicable to Taiwan’s defense, the authorities said. Military officials said that Mr. Schultz had given his contact in China technical manuals for the HH-60 helicopter and the F-22A fighter aircraft, along with a tactical playbook on how to counter unmanned aerial systems in large-scale combat operations. According to the indictment, Mr. Schultz unsuccessfully tried to recruit another Army intelligence officer to help him obtain more sensitive documents for the conspirator, who reportedly lived in Hong Kong and worked for a geopolitical consulting firm overseas.

"Millennium Challenge Corporation staff members were offered early retirement or deferred resignation in the latest effort by the Trump administration to gut the foreign aid apparatus.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Millennium Challenge Corporation staff members were offered early retirement or deferred resignation in the latest effort by the Trump administration to gut the foreign aid apparatus. By Aishvarya Kavi Reporting from Washington The Trump administration has begun dismantling a small independent agency that aids the economic development of poor but stable nations, according to five people familiar with the matter. Employees for the agency, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, were told in an email that they would be offered early retirement or deferred resignation after visits last week from Elon Musk’s government cost-cutting team, according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times. “We understand from the DOGE team there will soon be a significant reduction in the number of MCC’s programs and relatedly the agency’s staff,” read an email sent to staff on Tuesday by the acting chief executive. Staff members were given until Tuesday to decide whether to accept an offer to step down or have their employment terminated as soon as May 5, according to the email. The White House declined to comment Wednesday on the planned cuts at the agency. Mr. Musk’s team, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, has in recent weeks moved to gut several federal agencies and entities that work on foreign aid and development projects. That includes the U.S. African Development Foundation and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which would shrink to just the legally required 15 positions after employing about 10,000 people before the start of the Trump administration. The Millennium Challenge Corporation is much smaller — roughly 300 employees, mostly in Washington, with about 20 people in offices overseas. But like U.S.A.I.D., it is slated to be reduced to the minimum required by law, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about internal conversations. The agency, established by Congress in 2004, was conceived by President George W. Bush as a way to aid poor nations while holding them accountable for using U.S. funds responsibly. The agency’s annual budget is a relatively modest $1 billion. It provides grants directly to foreign governments for development projects, including ones aimed at limiting the influence of China in Asia and Africa.

By Eric Schmitt and Greg Jaffe Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had the consumer messaging app Signal set up on a computer in his office at the Pentagon so that he could send and receive instant messages in a space where personal cellphones are not permitted, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Hegseth’s move facilitated easier communications in a building where cell service is poor and personal phones are not allowed in certain areas. It was first reported by The Washington Post. The defense secretary has two computers in his office, one for personal use and one that is government-issued, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. Both spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Mr. Hegseth had cables installed in early March so that he could connect a private computer to Signal, according to a second person with knowledge of the matter. His confidential assistant and Col. Ricky Buria, his junior military aide, had the same Signal capability, the person said. The latest revelation came after The New York Times reported that Mr. Hegseth had shared highly sensitive and detailed attack plans in a Signal chat group that included his wife, his brother and his personal lawyer hours before a mission was launched against Houthi targets in Yemen on March 15.

By Elizabeth Dias and Ruth Graham Elizabeth Dias and Ruth Graham cover religion and faith. For 12 years, Pope Francis was the most powerful Christian on the world stage, using his voice to elevate the poor and the marginalized. Millions of progressive Christians in the United States, Catholics and non-Catholics alike, considered him to be a powerful counterweight to a rising conservative Christian power. He was the magnetic center for their values. His death on Monday leaves behind a question gnawing inside their minds. In a world without Pope Francis, where their values feel particularly vulnerable, where do they go from here? “This moment is critical now,” Bishop Sean W. Rowe, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, said. “For those of us who want to embody the Sermon on the Mount, and the Beatitudes, and the love that Jesus showed in the world, this is now more important than ever.” Pope Francis stood in contrast to a brand of Christianity that has increasing power in the United States. It is mixed with nationalism and, according to Bishop Rowe, is “not only fundamentally not Christian” but “also dangerous.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"A 50-state program announced by the Democratic Party seeks to build on past efforts and help recruit candidates to take on Republicans in less-friendly terrain.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by A 50-state program announced by the Democratic Party seeks to build on past efforts and help recruit candidates to take on Republicans in less-friendly terrain. By Nick Corasaniti and Shane Goldmacher The Democratic National Committee is pledging to give tens of thousands of dollars monthly to every state party across the country, emphasizing red states over blue ones, in an expansive — and expensive — push to make Democrats competitive from Alaska to Florida. The D.N.C. will spend more than $1 million a month on the 50-state program, which is increasing the organization’s monthly cash donations to state parties in red states by 50 percent and in blue states by 30 percent. The extra money to red states, the D.N.C. argues, is to build long-term infrastructure in places where it is currently lacking to create possibilities in elections beyond just the upcoming midterms. The monthly price tag: $17,500 to each state party in a blue state, and $22,500 in a red state. (The party has a formula that looks at governor, Senate, House and state legislative seats to determine whether a state is red or blue.) While the cash infusion will not pay for expensive television ad campaigns or create robust Democratic successes in red states overnight, it will help state parties hire more staff members, open new field offices and invest in data and tech operations, according to the D.N.C. Democrats have been scrambling to find a footing in the second Trump era, navigating a frustrated base eager for a more pugilistic stance against the administration while leadership looks for opportunities to claw back voters President Trump pried away in 2024. This effort is one of the first major initiatives announced by Ken Martin, the recently elected head of the D.N.C. “When I ran for D.N.C. chair, I said two things over and over,” Mr. Martin said in a statement. “First, we have to get the D.N.C. out of D.C. and into the states. Second, we have to organize everywhere and compete everywhere if we’re going to win everywhere.

"In a post on Instagram, Mr. McFarland announced he was selling the Fyre brand and its “cultural capital,” a month before Fyre Festival 2 was scheduled to begin.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by In a post on Instagram, Mr. McFarland announced he was selling the Fyre brand and its “cultural capital,” a month before Fyre Festival 2 was scheduled to begin. By Ali Watkins Vincent van Gogh once advised aspiring artists to treat their creative pursuits like a flame: “One must never let the fire go out in one’s soul,” he said, “but keep it burning.” Billy McFarland, a felon whose so-called creative pursuits have cost victims millions of dollars, has burned down plenty along the way. His internationally mocked and infinitely memed Fyre Festival in 2017, now cultural shorthand for hubris of the elite, was a scam that sent Mr. McFarland to prison for nearly four years. While awaiting sentencing in the Fyre Festival case, Mr. McFarland started a V.I.P. ticket service that promised users tickets he didn’t have to events like the Broadway musical “Hamilton” and the Met Gala. In recent months, Mr. McFarland had pivoted to Fyre Festival 2, a moderately-hyped attempt at redemption. That effort — perhaps blessedly, for all who optimistically bought the exorbitantly priced tickets (ranging from $1,400 to $1.1 million) — appeared to be over before it even started. Playa del Carmen, the city in Mexico that Mr. McFarland claimed would host the event, publicly snubbed him, saying there was no record of the festival and it would not be hosted on its shores. Now, a month before Fyre Festival 2 was supposedly set to kick off, Mr. McFarland is putting out his Fyre for good: He announced he would sell the brand and all its trappings to the highest bidder. “This brand is bigger than any one person,” Mr. McFarland said in a statement posted to Instagram on Wednesday. “It’s clear that I need to step back and allow a new team to move forward independently.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Ms. Noem “could feel this person as they snatched her bag,” a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Ms. Noem “could feel this person as they snatched her bag,” a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said. By Hamed Aleaziz Reporting from Washington The person who stole Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s handbag containing $3,000 in cash over the weekend was wearing a medical mask and snatched the bag from underneath her chair, officials said. “She could feel this person as they snatched her bag, but thought they were her grandchildren playing until realizing a minute later that her bag was gone,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security. “Her bag was under her feet and the perpetrator hooked the bag with his foot and dragged it across the floor and put a coat over it and took it.” The theft happened on Sunday night at the Capital Burger, an upscale pub-style restaurant in downtown Washington where Ms. Noem was having dinner with her family. The handbag also held her driver’s license, medication, apartment keys and blank checks. The theft is the latest episode to raise questions about the performance of the Secret Service, which has been under intense scrutiny since President Trump was the target of two assassination attempts last year. It is not clear how the thief was able to get so close to Ms. Noem and walk out with her bag under the eyes of the agents on the scene. Asked why Ms. Noem was carrying so much cash, Ms. McLaughlin said: “Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren. She was using the withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities and Easter gifts.” Ms. Noem runs a department that is in charge of the nation’s security, including border control and immigration and terrorism protection. By virtue of her position, she also has a round-the-clock security detail. According to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the Secret Service’s investigation, agents were present in the restaurant at the time of the theft. The official added that footage from the restaurant’s security cameras showed the person who stole Ms. Noem’s bag was wearing what a law enforcement official described as a “Covid-style mask,” obscuring parts of his face. The official said the investigation had produced some leads. Staff members at the Capital Burger declined to take a call about the incident. The restaurant, one of several Capital Burger locations along the East Coast, is owned by Darden Restaurants, an Orlando, Fla.-based operator that also owns the Capital Grille and the Olive Garden, among other dining brands. A spokesman for Darden Restaurants did not immediately return a call for comment. Hamed Aleaziz covers the Department of Homeland Security and immigration policy for The Times.

"The bill, which divided Republicans, would have required most libraries to keep material deemed sexually explicit away from minors.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The bill, which divided Republicans, would have required most libraries to keep material deemed sexually explicit away from minors. By Mitch Smith Gov. Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota vetoed a bill this week that would have required most libraries in the state to keep material considered sexually explicit in areas difficult for minors to access. Under the measure, librarians who do not comply could have faced prosecution. Mr. Armstrong, a Republican former congressman in his first year as governor, said in his veto message that the bill “represents a misguided attempt to legislate morality through overreach and censorship.” “The bill imposes vague and punitive burdens on professionals,” Mr. Armstrong added in a letter dated Tuesday, “and opens the door to a host of unintended and damaging consequences for our communities.”  The legislature could override the veto with a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and House, but the bill passed the House with a narrow, 49-to-45 majority. Republicans hold large majorities in both chambers. The legislation was part of a broader push by conservatives to restrict access to library books that they consider inappropriate for children, an effort that has alarmed many librarians and free speech advocates. New library laws or regulations have been approved in recent years in several Republican-led states, including Idaho, Iowa, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah.

The vice chair, David Hogg, 25, had announced last week that he planned to spend money in Democratic primaries through his outside group, Leaders We Deserve, and that he hoped to raise $20 million for the effort. That set off a storm of criticism from Democrats angry at the idea that a top party official would be putting his finger on the scale in primary contests. On Thursday, Mr. Martin responded publicly for the first time, declaring, “No D.N.C. officer should ever attempt to influence the outcome of a primary.” Mr. Martin said he had “great respect” for Mr. Hogg and understood his goals, yet he issued what amounted to an ultimatum: Mr. Hogg was “more than free” to fund primary challenges, just not as an officer of the D.N.C. Mr. Martin made his comments on a call with reporters announcing plans to expand grants to the party’s operations in red states. At a private meeting last month, all of the committee’s officers — except Mr. Hogg — signed a pledge promising to remain neutral in primary races.

"Lower courts had blocked the policy, saying it was not supported by evidence and violated equal protection principles.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Lower courts had blocked the policy, saying it was not supported by evidence and violated equal protection principles. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington The Trump administration on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to let it start enforcing a ban on transgender troops serving in the military that has been blocked by lower courts. The administration’s emergency application was the latest in a series of requests asking the justices to pause decisions by trial judges that prevent it from moving forward with the blitz of executive orders Mr. Trump has signed. The Supreme Court has allowed some initiatives to proceed and temporarily blocked others, issuing orders that have for the most part been technical and tentative. The new case concerns an order issued on the first day of Mr. Trump’s second term. It revoked an executive order from President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that had let transgender service members serve openly. A week later, Mr. Trump issued a second order saying that expressing what it called a false “gender identity” conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an “honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life,” and that requiring others to recognize a “falsehood is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.” In February, the Defense Department implemented Mr. Trump’s order, issuing a new policy requiring all transgender troops to be forced out of the military. According to the Defense Department, about 4,200 current service members, or about 0.2 percent of the military, are transgender. Service members sued to block the policy, saying it ran afoul of the Constitution’s equal protection clause. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"In three cases, federal judges paused the administration’s effort to cut off money from public schools with diversity and equity programs.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by In three cases, federal judges paused the administration’s effort to cut off money from public schools with diversity and equity programs. By Dana Goldstein President Trump was dealt a setback in his plans for American public education, as three federal judges issued separate rulings on Thursday pausing his ability to withhold funds from schools with diversity and equity initiatives. The rulings block the administration, at least for now, from carrying out efforts to cut off billions of dollars that pay for teachers, counselors and academic programs in schools that serve low-income children. Two of the judges who issued the decisions were appointed by Mr. Trump. A third was appointed by President Barack Obama. The cases were brought by teachers’ unions and the N.A.A.C.P., among others. In one of the cases, Judge Landya B. McCafferty of the Federal District Court in New Hampshire said that the administration had not provided an adequately detailed definition of “diversity, equity and inclusion.” She also said the policy threatened to restrict free speech in the classroom, while overstepping the executive branch’s legal authority over local schools. The loss of federal funding “would cripple the operations of many educational institutions,” wrote Judge McCafferty, who was appointed by Mr. Obama. The three rulings followed a demand earlier this month by the Trump administration that all 50 state education agencies attest in writing that their schools do not use certain D.E.I. practices. Otherwise, they would risk losing billions in Title I money, which supports low-income students. The deadline for returning that document was Thursday, and about a dozen states, most of which lean Democratic, refused to sign. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The case, involving a 20-year-old Venezuelan, comes on the heels of another legal battle over the fate of a different man wrongfully sent to El Salvador by the Trump administration.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The case, involving a 20-year-old Venezuelan, comes on the heels of another legal battle over the fate of a different man wrongfully sent to El Salvador by the Trump administration. By Alan Feuer and Hamed Aleaziz A federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to take steps to seek the return of a 20-year-old Venezuelan man who was deported to El Salvador last month, ruling that his removal violated a previous court settlement intended to protect young migrants with pending asylum cases. The decision on Wednesday by the judge, Stephanie A. Gallagher, came two weeks after the Supreme Court ordered the White House to seek the release of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, another migrant who was wrongfully sent to El Salvador as part of the same deportation operation. Judge Gallagher’s ruling, which cited Mr. Abrego Garcia’s case, was notable for the way it suggested that errors and violations of court directives continued to plague President Trump’s aggressive plan to deport as many as 1 million people in his first year in office. It also raised the question of how the administration would react to a second judge’s explicit instructions to “facilitate” the return of a wrongly deported migrant. Judge Paula Xinis, who is handling Mr. Abrego Garcia’s case in the same federal courthouse in Maryland, is still trying to enforce her order directing the White House to facilitate his release. But Mr. Trump has repeatedly washed his hands of the matter, claiming he is powerless to bring Mr. Abrego Garcia back to the United States. The second case involves the 20-year-old Venezuelan identified in court papers only as Cristian. After being convicted of drug charges in January, court papers say, he was deemed by the administration to be subject to Mr. Trump’s recent proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law.

"Even before the presidential election, the school began preparing for Donald Trump’s potential return to power. Now faculty members are resigning in protest.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Even before the presidential election, the school began preparing for Donald Trump’s potential return to power. Now faculty members are resigning in protest. By John Ismay John Ismay, a Pentagon reporter based in Washington, was commissioned as an officer from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1999. For 65 years, the U.S. Naval Academy’s annual foreign affairs conference has been a marquee event on campus, bringing in students from around the world for a week of lectures and discussions with high-ranking diplomats and officials. But this year, the event was abruptly canceled, just weeks before it was set to start. The conference had two strikes against it — its theme and timing. Organized around the idea of “The Constellation of Humanitarian Assistance: Persevering Through Conflict,” it was set for April 7 through 11, just as the Trump administration finished dismantling almost all of the federal government’s foreign aid programs. According to the academy, each foreign affairs conference takes a year to plan. But killing it off was much faster, and the decision to do so is among the many ways the school’s leadership has tried to anticipate the desires of an unpredictable and vengeful president. The moves have included Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s order last month that led to the banning of hundreds of books at the academy’s library, and the school’s cancellation of even more events that might attract the ire of President Trump or his supporters. Most colleges and universities decide what courses to teach and what events to hold on their campuses. But military service academies like the Navy’s in Annapolis, Md., are part of the Pentagon’s chain of command, which starts with the commander in chief. The Naval Academy said in a statement that it was reviewing all previously scheduled events to ensure that they aligned with executive orders and military directives. Representatives for the academy and for the Navy declined to comment for this article, but school officials have said privately that their institution’s academic freedom is under full-scale assault by the White House and the Pentagon.

"The man fired from a rooftop during a Fourth of July celebration in a Chicago suburb three years ago. The judge called the gunman “irretrievably depraved.”",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The man fired from a rooftop during a Fourth of July celebration in a Chicago suburb three years ago. The judge called the gunman “irretrievably depraved.” By Julie Bosman Reporting from Waukegan, Ill. The man who opened fire from a rooftop at a Fourth of July parade in a Chicago suburb in 2022 was sentenced on Thursday to seven consecutive life sentences, one for each of the people he killed. The man, Robert Crimo III, was also sentenced to a 50-year term in prison for attempted murder for each of the 48 people who were wounded at the parade but survived. He is not eligible for parole. In reading the sentence, Judge Victoria A. Rossetti of Lake County Circuit Court called Mr. Crimo “irretrievably depraved,” a man who has demonstrated no remorse for his crimes. “No sentence can ever change the events of July 4,” she said. “Nor can it compensate for the loss of a loved one or injured.” About two dozen relatives of the victims gathered in the courtroom gallery to hear the sentence. Some of them sobbed; others leaned their heads on their relatives’ shoulders for support. Mr. Crimo avoided a trial in the case by pleading guilty in March to 69 criminal counts, including first-degree murder. During the two-day sentencing hearing that began Wednesday morning, witnesses recounted the terror and chaos of the shooting in Highland Park, Ill., recalling how they fled with their families and saw people lying bloodied in the street. In remarks to the court, Eric Rinehart, the Lake County state’s attorney, described a community that was shattered. Mr. Crimo created “an ocean of grief, pain, heartache and loss,” he said. “Many believe that the sentence you give cannot redress this.” Gregory Ticsay, a lawyer for Mr. Crimo, said in court on Thursday that Mr. Crimo had resigned himself to a life sentence. “He has pleaded guilty with the understanding that he will spend the rest of his life in prison,” he said. Mr. Crimo, who is being held in the Lake County jail, refused to appear at the hearing all day Wednesday and again on Thursday. Judge Rossetti said that the sentencing would go on without him. “He was told if he did not appear, we could proceed in his absence, including the sentencing, so we will proceed,” Judge Rossetti said on Thursday. Erica Weeder, who was wounded by shrapnel during the shooting, spoke in court on Thursday about the lasting effects that the shooting had on her psyche. Now, she said, she is bothered by fireworks, by the loud noises of construction sites, by the rumble of the L train. “I lost some of my deep keel,” she said. “Some of my ability to bounce back from stressful events is simply gone.” Killed in the shooting were Stephen Straus, 88; Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza, 78; Eduardo Uvaldo, 69; Katherine Goldstein, 64; Jacquelyn Sundheim, 63; Irina McCarthy, 35, and her husband, Kevin McCarthy, 37.

"The suit seeks to preserve some of the main guardrails within the agency, all created by Congress, that help uncover and prevent human rights abuses.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Federal Layoffs Advertisement Supported by The suit seeks to preserve some of the main guardrails within the agency, all created by Congress, that help uncover and prevent human rights abuses. By Zach Montague and Hamed Aleaziz Reporting from Washington An assortment of advocacy groups filed a lawsuit on Thursday aimed at stopping the Department of Homeland Security from permanently shuttering its internal oversight divisions after the Trump administration fired critical staff members, grinding operations to a halt. The lawsuit was filed in Washington, D.C., brought by Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, along with two immigration rights groups. It seeks to preserve some of the main guardrails within the agency, all created by Congress, that help uncover and prevent human rights abuses by its officers. The suit asked the court to restore the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to the status quo before President Trump began to cut away at oversight and accountability functions throughout the federal government. It is also seeking to restore two ombudsman’s offices that inspect detention facilities and process complaints regarding visa applications. The Trump administration has said that layoffs at the Homeland Security Department and elsewhere are part of an overarching effort to reduce bureaucratic redundancies. A spokeswoman for the department, Tricia McLaughlin, said at the time that the layoffs were made in the name of efficiency. “These offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining D.H.S.’s mission,” she said. “Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.” But in the complaint filed on Thursday, the groups argued that the Trump administration had taken a specific interest in removing limitations and safeguards within immigration enforcement.

"A longtime provision of federal law called Swampbuster, which has protected millions of acres of wetland from being farmed, is facing a legal challenge.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by A longtime provision of federal law called Swampbuster, which has protected millions of acres of wetland from being farmed, is facing a legal challenge. By Mitch Smith Reporting from Delaware, Iowa Driving through the gently sloping terrain of northeast Iowa, there is little to distinguish Jim Conlan’s land, a stretch of light brown dirt sprinkled with tallgrass and maples, from the other fields where soybeans and cornstalks will soon sprout from the ground. But if Mr. Conlan has his way, his plot in Delaware County will lead to a permanent change in how farmland is used across the country. For 40 years, to remain eligible for federal crop insurance and other government programs, American farmers have been required to preserve wetlands on their properties. That federal provision, known as Swampbuster, has been credited by environmentalists with keeping countless acres of vulnerable land unplowed, and has been upheld over the decades by Republican and Democratic administrations. But where conservationists see an essential guardrail against habitat destruction, Mr. Conlan sees government run amok. Backed by legal groups that support libertarian causes, Mr. Conlan is challenging Swampbuster in federal court, asking not just to open nine acres of wetland in his field to cultivation, but to have that entire provision of federal law deemed unconstitutional. He is seeking to build on a series of recent court decisions that have reduced the role of federal agencies in regulating private land and have rolled back wetland protections. “The bigger principle is that the federal government doesn’t have the authority to regulate private property,” said Loren Seehase, a lawyer at the Liberty Justice Center who is among those representing Mr. Conlan’s company, CTM Holdings.

"The president ordered an inquiry into ActBlue, the main Democratic fund-raising platform, in his latest move using the government to target political opponents.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The president ordered an inquiry into ActBlue, the main Democratic fund-raising platform, in his latest move using the government to target political opponents. By Maggie HabermanReid J. Epstein and Kenneth P. Vogel President Trump on Thursday directed the Justice Department to investigate ActBlue, the fund-raising platform that powers virtually every Democratic candidate and cause. The move steps up Republicans’ effort to cripple their opponents’ political infrastructure. It was the third time in three weeks that Mr. Trump has directed the government to target a perceived political enemy. He has drastically expanded the use of his powers to try to damage domestic opponents, eroding a post-Watergate norm of Justice Department independence far more than he ever did in his first term. Mr. Trump called for an investigation by Attorney General Pam Bondi into ActBlue, which is used across the Democratic Party’s ecosystem to collect donations online. The inquiry is ostensibly meant to look into possible illegal donations made by people in someone else’s name, known as straw donations, as well as hard-dollar contributions from foreign donors. Mr. Trump asked for a report on the results of Ms. Bondi’s investigation within 180 days. Mr. Trump’s action represents a threat to one of the key financial cogs of the left, potentially hindering Democrats’ ability to compete in elections. It is likely to please elements of his base, for whom ActBlue has become a top target. Congressional Republicans have separately been investigating what they claim are the platform’s insufficient security provisions. For days, Democratic groups had worried that the White House was planning executive orders or memorandums that would target an array of nonprofit organizations. White House officials insisted no such orders were being drafted and maintained that stance for days. Just over two weeks ago, Mr. Trump signed memorandums targeting two officials from his first term for investigation. One, Miles Taylor, has been deeply critical of the president. The other, Chris Krebs, was targeted for rejecting Mr. Trump’s false claims of widespread election fraud involving voting machines. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The president does not have the authority to require proof of citizenship for all voters, a federal judge ruled.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The president does not have the authority to require proof of citizenship for all voters, a federal judge ruled. By Nick Corasaniti A federal judge blocked part of an expansive executive order signed last month seeking to overhaul election laws, writing on Thursday that President Trump did not have the authority to require documentary proof of citizenship for all voters. “Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the states — not the president — with the authority to regulate federal elections,” wrote Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court in Washington. She pointed to federal voting legislation being considered in Congress, adding that the president could not “short-circuit Congress’s deliberative process by executive order.” But the judge did not block another key part of the executive order that sought to force a deadline for mail ballots in federal elections by withholding federal funding from states that failed to comply with the deadline. She found that the Democrats who brought the legal challenge did not have standing to do so. The legal concerns with this provision, Judge Kollar-Kotelly wrote, are being considered in other cases brought by state attorneys general. The executive order, signed in early March, sought to direct the federal Election Assistance Commission to amend its voter registration form and require any potential voter to show documentary proof of citizenship to register. Acceptable documents included passports, military IDs or other state-issued identification that clarified citizenship. The executive order did not directly mention birth certificates as a valid way to prove citizenship. In a statement, the Trump administration vowed to continue the legal battle in court. “President Trump will keep fighting for election integrity, despite Democrat objections that reveal their disdain for common-sense safeguards like verifying citizenship,” said Harrison Fields, a spokesman for the White House. “Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our constitutional republic, and we’re confident in securing an ultimate victory in the courtroom.” Democrats celebrated the ruling. “Today’s court victory represents a huge step in the fight to protect our democracy,” the party said in a statement. “Without this decision, Americans across the country — including married women who changed their last name and low-income individuals — could have been unable to register to vote.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Burck underscored both the entanglements between Mr. Trump’s presidency and company and the degree to which he will look to target people he believes have wronged him. By Maggie Haberman and Ben Protess President Trump on Thursday directed his sons to fire an outside ethics counsel for the family business because the lawyer also represents Harvard University, one of Mr. Trump’s targets in his crackdown on the nation’s top colleges. In a social media post, Mr. Trump said the lawyer, William A. Burck, should go because of his ties to Harvard. The university sued the Trump administration after it threatened to slash billions in funding unless the school complied with a list of demands. “Harvard is a threat to Democracy, with a lawyer, who represents me, who should therefore be forced to resign, immediately, or be fired,” Mr. Trump wrote about Mr. Burck, a comanaging partner at the firm Quinn Emanuel. “He’s not that good, anyway, and I hope that my very big and beautiful company, now run by my sons, gets rid of him ASAP!” In a statement, one of the sons, Eric Trump, confirmed that the Trump Organization intended to cut ties to Mr. Burck over his decision to represent Harvard. “I view it as a conflict, and I will be moving in a different direction,” he said. Mr. Burck declined to comment. The move underscored not just the entanglements between the Trump presidency and his private company but also the degree to which Mr. Trump will look to target people he believes have wronged him.

"A federal judge in San Francisco who issued a nearly identical order in 2017 found himself intervening again to stop President Trump from punishing cities over their immigration policy.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by A federal judge in San Francisco who issued a nearly identical order in 2017 found himself intervening again to stop President Trump from punishing cities over their immigration policy. By Zach Montague Reporting from Washington A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the government from enforcing part of one of President Trump’s executive orders that directs agencies to withhold funds from cities and counties that don’t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. In a brief order, the judge, William H. Orrick of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California, found himself retreading old ground, intervening to stop a tactic he described as nearly identical to one Mr. Trump tried early in his first term. “Here we are again,” he wrote. As he did eight years ago, Judge Orrick prohibited the government from “taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funds” based on the president’s order or a related memo Attorney General Pam Bondi sent on Feb. 5 to outline ways agencies could suspend federal payments. Mr. Trump’s directive inspired a legal challenge from 16 city and county governments. They argued that the order violated the Constitution’s spending clause, which vests in Congress the power to finance programs and sway state behavior through federal funding. After Judge Orrick issued his ruling in 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit quickly upheld it, creating a straightforward precedent for him this time around. As in many similar cases involving the freezing of federal funds, the Trump administration’s rapid-fire approach has left it on shaky footing in court. Decisions to abruptly terminate federal programs Mr. Trump has described as wasteful, or to withhold them as leverage to force local governments to fall in line with his political agenda, have repeatedly left the government vulnerable to lawsuits claiming that the sudden changes had been made without due process or otherwise infringed on Congress’s authority. Judge Orrick wrote that the move threatened to disrupt local governance, harming residents in the process. “The threat to withhold funding causes them irreparable injury in the form of budgetary uncertainty, deprivation of constitutional rights, and undermining trust between the cities and counties and the communities they serve,” he wrote. The ruling was limited to the 16 cities and counties involved in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs are mostly in California, but they also include Minneapolis; Santa Fe, N.M.; and New Haven, Conn. As with much of Mr. Trump’s second-term agenda, the immigration policies his administration has pursued have been notably bolder and more explicit this time around, which Judge Orrick noted in the order. Reflecting on the similarities between the current case and the one he considered in 2017, he wrote that the harms facing the cities and counties had grown only more concrete and serious as the Trump administration has ratcheted up its enforcement efforts. But in granting the injunction, which will last through the duration of the lawsuit, he noted that as the retaliatory posture toward those cities and counties had crystallized, their case against the government had grown stronger in kind. “Their well-founded fear of enforcement is even stronger than it was in 2017,” he wrote.

"An expert on the federal work force estimates that the speed and chaos of Mr. Musk’s cuts to the bureaucracy will cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Federal Layoffs Advertisement Supported by An expert on the federal work force estimates that the speed and chaos of Mr. Musk’s cuts to the bureaucracy will cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year. By Elizabeth Williamson Reporting from Washington President Trump and Elon Musk promised taxpayers big savings, maybe even a “DOGE dividend” check in their mailboxes, when the Department of Government Efficiency was let loose on the federal government. Now, as he prepares to step back from his presidential assignment to cut bureaucratic fat, Mr. Musk has said without providing details that DOGE is likely to save taxpayers only $150 billion. That is about 15 percent of the $1 trillion he pledged to save, less than 8 percent of the $2 trillion in savings he had originally promised and a fraction of the nearly $7 trillion the federal government spent in the 2024 fiscal year. The errors and obfuscations underlying DOGE’s claims of savings are well documented. Less known are the costs Mr. Musk incurred by taking what Mr. Trump called a “hatchet” to government and the resulting firings, agency lockouts and building seizures that mostly wound up in court. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit organization that studies the federal work force, has used budget figures to produce a rough estimate that firings, re-hirings, lost productivity and paid leave of thousands of workers will cost upward of $135 billion this fiscal year. At the Internal Revenue Service, a DOGE-driven exodus of 22,000 employees would cost about $8.5 billion in revenue in 2026 alone, according to figures from the Budget Lab at Yale University. The total number of departures is expected to be as many as 32,000. Neither of these estimates includes the cost to taxpayers of defending DOGE’s moves in court. Of about 200 lawsuits and appeals related to Mr. Trump’s agenda, at least 30 implicate the department. “Not only is Musk vastly overinflating the money he has saved, he is not accounting for the exponentially larger waste that he is creating,” said Max Stier, the chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service. “He’s inflicted these costs on the American people, who will pay them for many years to come.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Some federal workers said they were insulted by the idea of the workshops. By Eileen Sullivan and Madeleine Ngo Reporting from Washington Need help mastering a job search? Some tips on attracting a private-sector gig? For employees who still have jobs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the agency’s human resources division is offering “career support” sessions, according to a recent email obtained by The New York Times. “This session is designed to meet you where you are,” the Housing and Urban Development notification said, hinting at the protracted uncertainty that has loomed over most federal employees since President Trump returned to the Oval Office. The agency did notrespond to questions about how many employees would be offered this workshop or whether those who had been fired or left would be included. The rapid, indiscriminate job cuts and efforts to pressure workers to resign made by the Trump administration and Elon Musk have rattled the federal work force rattled — which faces the prospect of yet more mass firings in the pursuit of Mr. Trump’s goal to shrink and overhaul the civil service. The majority of government agencies have yet to announce their latest round of layoffs as part of the administration’s “reduction in force.” Those could come any day. The Department of Transportation is offering similar workshops to its employees, Politico reported on Tuesday. Some federal workers said they were insulted by the idea of such sessions, which they read as another attempt by the Trump administration to encourage them to quit their jobs. One H.U.D. employee said it was disrespectful and confusing, asking why the agency would help its workers prepare to leave. The employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution, said those who still had jobs had found themselves taking on extra work to cover for those who had left or been terminated. According to the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources arm, the federal civilian work force had about 2.3 million employees at the beginning of the year. The personnel office has not said how many people are still employed after firings and resignations. In its first major downsizing effort, the Trump administration abruptly fired around 25,000 probationary workers in February. Those workers have been in employment limbo for months, at the mercy of legal battles that have led to a confusing yo-yo of reinstatements and refirings. Fired federal workers face a sluggish job market. Cory Stahle, an economist at the job search platform Indeed, said that applications from federal workers significantly increased between the beginning of the year and late March 2025. “The biggest question surrounding the early efforts to reduce federal head count is whether the labor market can absorb these displaced workers,” Mr. Stahle wrote in an article last month on Indeed’s “Hiring Lab” website. A majority of federal workers are well-educated, he said, and the market has shown less job availability in areas that hire such candidates. “This suggests that federal workers are likely to face greater challenges in their job search now than they might have a few years ago,” he wrote.

By Michael Levenson Rob Holland, a well-known aerobatic pilot, died on Thursday when his custom-built carbon fiber plane crashed at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, where he had been preparing to fly in an air show this weekend, according to a statement on his Facebook page. The Federal Aviation Administration said that the plane, an MXS model built by the MX Aircraft Company, crashed while trying to land at Langley at around 11:50 a.m. The F.A.A. and the National Transportation Safety Board were investigating the cause of the accident. The federal agencies did not identify the pilot, who was the only person in the plane. But the statement on Mr. Holland’s Facebook page confirmed that it was him. A professional air show and aerobatic pilot for more than 20 years, Mr. Holland was a 13-time U.S. national aerobatic champion, a six-time world four-minute freestyle champion and the 2015 World Air Games freestyle gold medalist, according to his website. Mr. Holland had been planning to fly this weekend in Air Power Over Hampton Roads, an air show at Langley, according to the event’s website. The show, which also features military jets such as the F-22 Raptor, attracts thousands of spectators. Langley confirmed a crash had occurred but did not immediately release further information. An N.T.S.B. investigator was expected to arrive at Langley on Friday morning, the agency said. The investigator will begin the process of documenting the scene and examining the aircraft. The plane will then be moved to a secure facility for further evaluation, the board said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"A new U.S. peace plan offered to Russia and Ukraine proposes American recognition of the peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Russia-Ukraine War Advertisement Supported by A new U.S. peace plan offered to Russia and Ukraine proposes American recognition of the peninsula, which Moscow seized in 2014. By Michael Crowley Reporting from Washington During President Trump’s first term, Ukraine worried that Mr. Trump might recognize Russian control over Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Moscow forcibly seized in early 2014. As a candidate, Mr. Trump had said he would “take a look” at the matter, even though the Obama administration and America’s Western allies had rejected Russia’s annexation of the strategic territory. Mr. Trump even mused that “the people of Crimea, from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia.” But Mr. Trump never followed through and even doubled down against Moscow. In July 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued an official “Crimea Declaration” pledging that the nonrecognition policy would remain “until Ukraine’s territorial integrity is restored.” Now, in his effort to negotiate an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, Mr. Trump is prepared to walk away from that declaration — and more than a decade of American policy. A new peace proposal the Trump administration offered in London on Wednesday would include U.S. recognition that Crimea is part of Russia, American and European officials said. Daniel Fried, a former diplomat with extensive experience with Ukraine and Russia, called it the worst element of the Trump proposal, which is widely seen as strongly favoring Moscow’s position in several ways.

By Jonathan Swan Reporting from Washington President Trump made an unusually sharp appeal to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Thursday, calling on him to stop his bombing campaign in Ukraine and agree to a peace deal after the deadliest attack on Kyiv in nearly a year. “Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Let’s get the Peace Deal DONE!” Mr. Trump wrote on social media. Russia’s missile attack came a day after the Trump administration threatened to abandon peace talks if Ukraine did not accept a U.S. peace proposal that heavily favored Russia. Mr. Trump’s comments were striking because he has mostly avoided even mild criticism of Mr. Putin in his handling of the talks so far. Instead, he has directed most of his anger toward President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, calling him a “dictator” and describing him as the main impediment to a peace deal. While Mr. Trump made clear he was running out of patience for the two sides to agree on a peace deal, he also sought to pre-emptively divert blame should the negotiations fall apart, a sign that he is perhaps more pessimistic than he was when he regained the presidency brimming with confidence about his talent as a negotiator.

"The Hope Florida Foundation quietly gave the money to two nonprofit political committees that helped Gov. Ron DeSantis and his allies defeat a ballot measure.",2025-04-24,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The Hope Florida Foundation quietly gave the money to two nonprofit political committees that helped Gov. Ron DeSantis and his allies defeat a ballot measure. By Patricia Mazzei Reporting from Miami A charity meant to help people stay off public assistance was the signature project of Florida’s popular first lady, Casey DeSantis. But over three years, it had managed to raise only about $2 million to help struggling families in Florida. Then last fall, a $10 million windfall suddenly arrived from an unlikely source: a Medicaid contractor embroiled in a case of overbilling. Within weeks, the money was gone — not to churches or other groups helping the needy. Instead, the Hope Florida Foundation quietly funneled it to two nonprofit political committees that helped Gov. Ron DeSantis and his allies defeat a November ballot measure that would have legalized marijuana. The mystery of the $10 million — and how it ended up being used to help the governor’s political aims — has engulfed Mr. DeSantis and his wife in a growing scandal in Florida. Republican state lawmakers and news reporters are investigating the money trail just as Mr. and Ms. DeSantis are mulling whether she should run for governor next year to succeed her husband. Ms. DeSantis has made the Hope Florida initiative central to her public persona since she started the program in 2021. Hope Florida connects low-income families with churches and local groups that might help them with housing, food or other needs so that they do not seek government assistance; the Hope Florida Foundation is its nonprofit fund-raising arm. “Hope Florida is a philosophy,” Ms. DeSantis said in St. Augustine, Fla., on Thursday at an event with the governor trumpeting the initiative’s achievements. “It shows we can help people in need.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"A declaration by an ICE official unsealed by a judge says the form was “read and explained” to Venezuelan detainees, who had “no less than 12 hours” to express an intent to mount a challenge.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Religious Charter School Challenge Advertisement Supported by A declaration by an ICE official unsealed by a judge says the form was “read and explained” to Venezuelan detainees, who had “no less than 12 hours” to express an intent to mount a challenge. By Mattathias Schwartz Mattathias Schwartz reported from the federal courthouse in Brownsville, Texas. On April 7, the Supreme Court ruled that the government must give Venezuelan migrants notice “within a reasonable time” and the chance to legally challenge their removal before being deported to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Exactly how much notice the Trump administration considered appropriate in response to the Supreme Court’s edict was revealed in a document unsealed during a hearing on Thursday in Federal District Court in Brownsville, Texas. Before Saturday, when the Supreme Court issued a second order, which blocked the deportation of a group of Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, detainees slated for deportation were given a one-page form that stated “if you desire to make a phone call, you will be permitted to do so,” according to the unsealed document, a four-page declaration by an official from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They then had “no less than 12 hours” to “express an intent” to challenge their detention, and another 24 hours to file a habeas corpus petition asking for a hearing before a judge, the declaration said. The form itself is written in English, but “it is read and explained to each alien in a language that alien understands.” The hearing was part of a case whose plaintiffs are three Venezuelan men being held at El Valle Detention Facility, roughly 50 miles from Brownsville. Lawyers for detainees held elsewhere, who have sued in the Northern District of Texas, have disputed the government’s claims about being given notice. They also have said that the form was not explained to detainees and that they were simply told to sign the document, which the ICE declaration identified as Form AEA-21B.

By Patricia Mazzei Reporting from Miami The highest-ranking Democrat in the Florida Senate announced in dramatic fashion on Thursday that he was leaving the party, the latest setback for Democrats whose influence in the state has rapidly diminished. State Senator Jason W.B. Pizzo, whose district includes parts of Miami-Dade and Broward Counties in South Florida, said in a speech on the Senate floor that he was changing his voter registration to “no party affiliation,” the most common registration in Florida for independent voters. “The Democratic Party in Florida is dead,” Mr. Pizzo told his fellow lawmakers. “There are good people that can resuscitate it. But they don’t want it to be me. That’s not convenient. That’s not cool.” Mr. Pizzo had signaled that he might run for governor next year. He had been visible in many high-profile debates, using his background as a former prosecutor to grill Republicans. But he was also sometimes at odds with fellow Democrats on matters of law and order. Earlier this week, he said critics had accused him of being a racist for calling for an audit of a South Florida municipality with a largely Black population. “I follow the law,” Mr. Pizzo said on the Senate floor on Wednesday. “If anybody’s feelings are hurt and think I’m a racist for my position — suck it.” Mr. Pizzo did not immediately respond to interview requests on Thursday. In a statement after Mr. Pizzo announced he was leaving the party, Nikki Fried, the chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party, called Mr. Pizzo “one of the most ineffective and unpopular Democratic leaders in recent memory” and said his resignation was “one of the best things to happen to the party in years.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The order declares that employees will only attain full employment status if their managers review and sign off on their performance, adding a new obstacle for probationary workers to clear.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Federal Layoffs Advertisement Supported by The order declares that employees will only attain full employment status if their managers review and sign off on their performance, adding a new obstacle for probationary workers to clear. By Eileen Sullivan Reporting from Washington President Trump issued an executive order on Thursday making it easier for the government to fire federal employees who are in a probationary period. Probationary government workers already have far fewer job protections than their established colleagues, and they were the Trump administration’s first targets for mass firings earlier this year. At least 24,000 of those terminations have led to court-ordered reinstatements that were overturned on appeals. Normally, probationary federal employees attain full status in one or two years, depending on the job — unless the agency they work for takes steps to dismiss them, which usually involves citing poor performance. Under the executive order, whose implications were outlined in a White House fact sheet, probationary employees will only attain full status if their managers review and sign off on their performance. “This is a very big step,” said Donald F. Kettl, professor emeritus and the former dean of the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy. “The administration has been looking for ways to cut probationary employees, and this puts more power in the hands of agency managers.” Probationary workers can range from young people entering the work force to longtime employees promoted to new positions. Many probationary employees are highly skilled, were recruited for specific roles and have been vetted throughout the government’s hiring process. Tens of thousands of probationary workers targeted by the Trump administration’s cuts have been in limbo for months. Most are on administrative leave and are getting paid, but have no indication of how long that will continue. Mr. Kettl said that the executive order Mr. Trump issued on Thursday suggested that the administration had learned some lessons from the court challenges to its mass firings. Once the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources arm, formally issues the new policy, the government will be in a better legal position to fire probationary employees, he said.

"The longtime Trump ally is lobbying Congress to change the law that the crypto entrepreneur Roger Ver was charged with violating.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The longtime Trump ally is lobbying Congress to change the law that the crypto entrepreneur Roger Ver was charged with violating. By Kenneth P. Vogel and David Yaffe-Bellany Kenneth P. Vogel reported from Washington, and David Yaffe-Bellany from New York. Roger J. Stone Jr., the longtime associate of President Trump’s, has been lobbying for a pioneering cryptocurrency investor known as “Bitcoin Jesus” who is facing federal fraud and criminal tax charges, according to congressional filings. Mr. Stone filed paperwork last month indicating that he had been retained by Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin investor who was charged last year and accused of shielding his cryptocurrency holdings from $48 million in taxes. Mr. Stone noted in a filing last week that he had been paid $600,000 by Mr. Ver since early February to help his client’s case, partly by trying to abolish the tax provisions at the heart of the charges. Mr. Ver, a former California resident who renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2014, was arrested last year in Spain, according to the Justice Department, which announced plans at the time to extradite him. Mr. Ver disputed the charges, claiming in a video posted on social media in January that he was being threatened with a possible sentence of more than 100 years in prison because of his political views and his role in promoting cryptocurrency. In the video, which was framed as an appeal to Mr. Trump, Mr. Ver linked his case to the president’s grievances about the weaponization of the justice system.

Some families wonder if the shutting of the schools is related to his D.E.I. retrenchment. By Heather KnightTheodore Schleifer and Orlando Mayorquín Heather Knight reported from East Palo Alto, Calif.; Theodore Schleifer reported from Washington, D.C.; and Orlando Mayorquín reported from Los Angeles. The Primary School opened in 2016, just a couple miles from Facebook’s headquarters. Its mission was to serve as a tuition-free hub where children from low-income families could be educated and have access to health care and social workers under one roof. Dr. Priscilla Chan, a pediatrician married to Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, worked with Meredith Liu, an educator and friend, to build the school in East Palo Alto, Calif., a diverse town that rarely reaps the benefits of its far wealthier Silicon Valley neighbors. They talked about how low-income children were more likely to have experienced trauma early in life, and how that trauma would have lasting effects. The Primary School, its website declared, tried to overcome the systemic racism and poverty that hurts communities of color. This week, however, school officials stunned families when they told parents the campus will shutter in the summer of 2026. Emeline Vainikolo said she and other parents were invited by school administrators to a breakfast of bagels, fruit and Starbucks coffee and were abruptly told of the closure, but given no reason. They were left staring at one another “dumbfounded,” she said. Her son, a kindergartner, later relayed a reason that he had gleaned from his teacher, she said. “‘Mommy, the guy who’s been giving money to our school doesn’t want to give it to us anymore,’” he told her.

"An updated lawsuit filed in Washington was the latest in a flurry of suits challenging the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to send migrants to a prison in El Salvador.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by An updated lawsuit filed in Washington was the latest in a flurry of suits challenging the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to send migrants to a prison in El Salvador. By Alan Feuer Over the past two weeks, immigration lawyers, scrambling from courthouse to courthouse, have secured provisional orders in five states stopping the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law, to deport Venezuelans accused of being gang members to a terrorism prison in El Salvador. Judges have been harsh in appraising how the White House has used the powerful statute. “Cows have better treatment now under the law,” a federal judge in Manhattan said on Tuesday. But at least so far, the one thing the lawyers have not managed to do is protect another — and harder to reach — group of Venezuelan migrants: about 140 men who are already in El Salvador, having been deported there under the act more than a month ago. Early Friday, the American Civil Liberties Union took another shot at seeking due process for those men. Lawyers for the group filed an updated version of a lawsuit they brought against President Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, the first that challenged his invocation of the law. This time, the A.C.L.U. is asking a federal judge in Washington not to stop the men from being sent to El Salvador, but rather to help them return to U.S. soil. When the A.C.L.U. filed its initial version of the suit, in Federal District Court in Washington, Judge James E. Boasberg issued an immediate order telling the administration to hold off sending any planes of Venezuelans to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act and to turn around any flights that were already in the air.

Now it is trying to save that legacy without violating the law. By Stephanie Saul One of the nation’s most elite liberal arts schools, Amherst College has historically also been one of its most diverse. In 2023, federal data revealed that its overall Black enrollment, 11 percent of the student body, far outstripped many other similar institutions. So it was particularly jarring to the Amherst community last fall when data for the entering freshman class revealed that only 3 percent of its members were Black. Quincy Smith, an art major, joined one of the most diverse classes in Amherst history in 2022 and said gatherings of Black students feel different now: “There’s less engagement, fewer people coming to our meetings and going to events.” At Amherst, a college of about 1,900 undergraduates in western Massachusetts, students and administrators alike are now uneasy as the idea of diversity, one of the school’s core values, is increasingly under attack by conservatives in Washington.

By Helene CooperJulian E. BarnesEric Schmitt and Christiaan Triebert Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s personal phone number, the one used in a recent Signal chat, was easily accessible on the internet and public apps as recently as March, potentially exposing national security secrets to foreign adversaries. The phone number could be found in a variety of places, including WhatsApp, Facebook and a fantasy sports site. It was the same number through which the defense secretary, using the Signal commercial messaging app, disclosed flight data for American strikes on the Houthi militia in Yemen. Cybersecurity analysts said an American defense secretary’s communications device would usually be among the most protected national security assets. “There’s zero percent chance that someone hasn’t tried to install Pegasus or some other spyware on his phone,” Mike Casey, the former director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said in an interview. “He is one of the top five, probably, most targeted people in the world for espionage.” Emily Harding, a defense and security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, added: “You just don’t want the secretary of defense’s phone number to be out there and available to anyone.” The chief Pentagon spokesman, Sean Parnell, did not respond to request for comment. Mr. Hegseth’s use of Signal to convey details of military strikes in Yemen first surfaced last month when the editor of The Atlantic wrote an article that said he had been added, apparently accidentally, to an encrypted chat among senior U.S. government officials. The New York Times reported this week that Mr. Hegseth included sensitive information about the strikes in a Signal group chat he set up that included his wife and brother, among others.

"The president said he would be “leading the pack” against Iran if it did not agree to a nuclear deal, but he said he was open to meeting Iranian leaders.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Middle East Tensions Advertisement Supported by The president said he would be “leading the pack” against Iran if it did not agree to a nuclear deal, but he said he was open to meeting Iranian leaders. By Adam Rasgon Reporting from Jerusalem If an agreement with Iran to limit its nuclear program proves elusive, the United States could spearhead military action against it, President Trump said in an interview published on Friday. Mr. Trump’s comments, in an interview with Time magazine marking his first three months in office, came as American and Iranian officials were set to meet for the third consecutive Saturday in an effort to reach an agreement that would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. After being asked if he was worried that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel might drag him into a war with Iran, Mr. Trump said: “I may go in very willingly if we can’t get a deal. If we don’t make a deal, I’ll be leading the pack.” Mr. Trump has said he thought the talks between the United States and Iran were going well, but officials on both sides have not achieved a breakthrough. Mr. Netanyahu has expressed openness to diplomacy if it leads to the full dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program — a demand that Iranian officials have rejected. Some Israeli officials have expressed concerns that the United States could agree to a deal that leaves some of Iran’s nuclear program in place. Mr. Netanyahu has avoided a public confrontation with Mr. Trump, but has issued a number of public statements saying Israel will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. Last week, The New York Times reported that Israel had planned an attack on Iranian nuclear sites, but was held back by Mr. Trump, who expressed support for attempting to negotiate an agreement with Iran first. Israeli officials have suggested that U.S. support for such strikes was crucial, both to ensure successful execution and to protect Israel against an Iranian response. Mr. Trump said he did not stop Israel from attacking Iran, but “didn’t make it comfortable for them.” “Ultimately I was going to leave that choice to them, but I said I would much prefer a deal than bombs being dropped,” he said. Mr. Trump also said he was open to meeting with Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, or its president, Masoud Pezeshkian.

"Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, who was accused of covering up cases of abuse as archbishop of Los Angeles, will have an official role in the ceremonies around Francis’ funeral.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Pope Succession Advertisement Supported by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, who was accused of covering up cases of abuse as archbishop of Los Angeles, will have an official role in the ceremonies around Francis’ funeral. By Jonathan Wolfe Follow our live coverage for the funeral of Pope Francis at St. Peter’s Basilica. An American cardinal who was accused of covering up cases of sexual abuse by priests and was later stripped of some duties, is set to play an official role in the ceremonies surrounding Pope Francis’ funeral. Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the former archbishop of Los Angeles, will participate in the closing of the pope’s casket at St. Peter’s Basilica on Friday evening and in his burial at the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore on Saturday, according to Vatican announcements. The cardinals taking part were chosen based on seniority, a spokesman for the Vatican, Matteo Bruni, said at a news briefing on Thursday. Cardinal Mahony, 89, was the archbishop of Los Angeles from 1985 until his retirement from the Roman Catholic Church in 2011. In 2013, internal church personnel files released as part of a civil case revealed that Cardinal Mahony had played a role in covering up cases of sexual abuse by priests. The documents show that Cardinal Mahony and others worked to protect abusive priests from punishment and withhold evidence of sexual abuse from law enforcement agencies. The Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the largest in the United States, also sent priests who had molested children out of state for treatment, in part because therapists in California were legally obligated to report evidence of child abuse to the police, according to the documents. In 2007, the Los Angeles archdiocese agreed to pay $660 million to settle claims from more than 500 victims, the largest settlement for priest sexual abuse at the time. Last year, the church agreed to pay another $880 million to settle abuse claims from 1,353 people. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"President Trump said that “we’re meeting with China” on tariffs, comments aimed at soothing jittery financial markets. But Chinese officials say no talks have taken place.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by President Trump said that “we’re meeting with China” on tariffs, comments aimed at soothing jittery financial markets. But Chinese officials say no talks have taken place. By Ana Swanson and Jonathan Swan President Trump, whose trade war with China has rattled financial markets and threatened to disrupt huge swaths of trade, suggested on Friday that he had been in touch with Xi Jinping, China’s president, even as Chinese officials insisted that no negotiations were occurring. In an interview with Time on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said Mr. Xi had called him, though he declined to say when, and asserted that his team was in active talks with China on a trade deal. Asked about the interview outside the White House on Friday morning, the president reiterated that he had spoken with the Chinese president “numerous times,” but he refused to answer when pressed on whether any call had happened after he imposed tariffs this month. Mr. Trump’s comments appeared aimed at creating the impression of progress with China to soothe jittery financial markets, which have fallen amid signs that the world’s largest economies are in a standoff. The S&P 500 is down 10 percent since Mr. Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. But the president’s claims of talks have been rejected by Chinese officials, who have repeatedly denied this week that they are actively negotiating with the United States. “China and the U.S. have not held consultations or negotiations on the issue of tariffs,” Guo Jiakun, the spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, said in a news conference on Friday. “The United States should not confuse the public.” Chinese officials have repeatedly said the United States should stop threatening China and engage in dialogue on the basis of equality and respect. On Thursday, He Yadong, a spokesman for China’s Commerce Ministry, said there were “no economic and trade negotiations between China and the United States.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The marshals are in an increasingly bitter conflict between two branches of government, even as funding for judges’ security has failed to keep pace with a steady rise in threats.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The marshals are in an increasingly bitter conflict between two branches of government, even as funding for judges’ security has failed to keep pace with a steady rise in threats. By Mattathias Schwartz and Emily Bazelon Mattathias Schwartz reports on the federal judiciary from Philadelphia. Emily Bazelon is a staff writer for the magazine who covers legal issues. On March 11, about 50 judges gathered in Washington for the biannual meeting of the Judicial Conference, which oversees the administration of the federal courts. It was the first time the conference met since President Trump retook the White House. In the midst of discussions of staffing levels and long-range planning, the judges’ conversations were focused, to an unusual degree, on rising threats against judges and their security, said several people who attended the gathering. Behind closed doors at one session, Judge Richard J. Sullivan, the chairman of the conference’s Committee on Judicial Security, raised a scenario that weeks before would have sounded like dystopian fiction, according to three officials familiar with the remarks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations: What if the White House were to withdraw the protections it provides to judges? The U.S. Marshals Service, which by law oversees security for the judiciary, is part of the Justice Department, which Mr. Trump is directly controlling in a way that no president has since the Watergate scandal. Judge Sullivan noted that Mr. Trump had stripped security protections from Mike Pompeo, his former secretary of state, and John Bolton, his former national security adviser. Could the federal judiciary, also a recent target of Mr. Trump’s ire, be next? Judge Sullivan, who was nominated by President George W. Bush and then elevated to an appellate judgeship by Mr. Trump, referred questions about his closed-door remarks to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, which stated its “complete confidence in those responsible for judicial security.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested on suspicion that she “intentionally misdirected federal agents away from” an immigrant being pursued by the authorities, the F.B.I. director said.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Wisconsin Judge Arrested Advertisement Supported by Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested on suspicion that she “intentionally misdirected federal agents away from” an immigrant being pursued by the authorities, the F.B.I. director said. By Devlin Barrett Devlin Barrett covers the F.B.I. and the Justice Department. F.B.I. agents arrested a Milwaukee judge on Friday on charges of obstructing immigration agents, saying she steered an undocumented immigrant through a side door in her courtroom while the agents waited to arrest him in a public hallway. The decision to charge a sitting state court judge is a major escalation in the Trump administration’s battle with local authorities over deportations. The administration has demanded, under threat of investigation or prosecution, that local officials not impede federal efforts to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, and the arrest sent a message that the administration intends to take a harder line with those that do. The arrest of the judge, Hannah Dugan, comes after months of rising tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary. President Trump and his top advisers have repeatedly assailed “local judges” for halting or questioning actions taken by the administration, particularly when it comes to immigration cases. Mr. Trump’s drive to round up and deport large numbers of migrants has also led to other disputes with federal judges, especially over his use of the Alien Enemies Act to send Venezuelans out of the country. In the Milwaukee case, charging documents described a confrontation last Friday at Judge Dugan’s courthouse, in which federal agents said she was “visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor” when a group of immigration, D.E.A. and F.B.I. agents came to apprehend Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a citizen of Mexico who was in her courtroom to face domestic violence charges. According to the criminal complaint, the judge confronted the agents and told them to talk to the chief judge of the courthouse. She then returned to her courtroom.

"Kristi Noem, the top official charged with patrolling the nation’s borders and protecting it from terrorist threats, was burgled in plain view of her security detail.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Kristi Noem, the top official charged with patrolling the nation’s borders and protecting it from terrorist threats, was burgled in plain view of her security detail. By Shawn McCreesh Reporting from Washington It is the mystery that has gripped Washington. On Sunday night, Kristi Noem, the head of the Department of Homeland Security, was dining downtown at Capital Burger with her family when a thief snatched her purse out from under her chair. The culprit scored, big time: The bag contained Ms. Noem’s driver’s license, medication, apartment keys, blank checks, department badge, passport and $3,000 in cash. The Capital Burger caper made for capital farce — the top official charged with patrolling the nation’s borders and protecting it from terrorist threats, burgled in plain view of her security detail. That it happened to Ms. Noem, of all cabinet officials, only added to the drama. In an administration full of ready-for-TV characters, Ms. Noem stands out. Last year, she drew attention for writing in her autobiography about shooting her dog who proved “untrainable” and “dangerous.” More recently, she made headlines for wearing a $50,000 gold Rolex Cosmograph Daytona watch while touring a notorious prison in El Salvador. In the photos and videos she posts in her role as homeland security secretary, she wears tactical gear, poses with guns and accompanies border agents on missions to nab migrants; even some of President Trump’s allies have characterized many of her actions as little more than stunts. The theft was common knowledge among the lunchtime crowd this week at Capital Burger, a pub that sits in the shadow of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. It’s the kind of place with a giant pretzel and “kung pao” brussels sprouts on the menu. “It’s a little weird,” said John Lauck, 28, who said he worked for the military and was in town from Texas. “I don’t know why anybody would have that much money on them.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"A draft document outlines steep cuts or the elimination of funding for programs that provide child care, housing assistance, foreign aid and health research.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by A draft document outlines steep cuts or the elimination of funding for programs that provide child care, housing assistance, foreign aid and health research. By Alan Rappeport and Tony Romm Reporting from Washington The Trump administration, which has made clear that it aims to slash government spending, is preparing to unveil a budget proposal as soon as next week that includes draconian cuts that would entirely eliminate some federal programs and fray the nation’s social safety net. The proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year would cut billions of dollars from programs that support child care, health research, education, housing assistance, community development and the elderly, according to preliminary documents reviewed by The New York Times. The proposal, which is being finalized by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, also targets longstanding initiatives that have been prized by Democrats and that Republicans view as “woke” or wasteful spending. Technically, the president’s blueprint is merely a formal recommendation to Congress, which must ultimately adopt any changes to spending. The full extent of President Trump’s proposed cuts for 2026 is not yet clear. Rachel Cauley, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, said in a statement that “no final funding decisions have been made.” But early indications suggest the budget will aim to formalize Mr. Trump’s disruptive reorganization of the federal government. That process — largely overseen by the tech billionaire Elon Musk — has frozen billions of dollars in aid, shuttered some programs and dismissed thousands of workers from their jobs, prompting numerous court challenges. The early blueprint reflects Mr. Trump’s long-held belief that some federal antipoverty programs are unnecessary or rife with waste, fraud and abuse. And it echoes many of the ideas espoused by his budget director, Russell T. Vought, a key architect of Project 2025 who subscribes to the view that the president has expansive powers to ignore Congress and cancel spending viewed as “woke and weaponized.” He previously endorsed some of the cuts to housing, education and other programs that Mr. Trump is expected to unveil in the coming days. The White House is expected to release the budget as soon as next week, according to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the highly secretive process. The president is expected to couple his blueprint for 2026 with a second measure — also set for release next week — that would slash more than $9 billion in previously approved spending for the current fiscal year, including money that funds PBS and NPR.

"Immigration officials signaled that the Trump administration would continue to pursue efforts to terminate the legal status of the students, despite a wave of legal challenges.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Immigration officials signaled that the Trump administration would continue to pursue efforts to terminate the legal status of the students, despite a wave of legal challenges. By Zach Montague and Hamed Aleaziz Reporting from Washington The Trump administration on Friday abruptly moved to restore thousands of international students’ ability to study in the United States legally, but immigration officials insisted they could still try to terminate that legal status despite a wave of legal challenges. The decision, revealed during a court hearing in Washington, was a dramatic shift by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even as the administration characterized it as only a temporary reprieve. The back and forth only contributed to the anxiety and confusion facing international students as the administration has moved to cancel more than 1,500 student visas in recent weeks. On Friday morning, Joseph F. Carilli, a Justice Department lawyer, told a federal judge in Washington that immigration officials had begun work on a new system for reviewing and terminating the records of international students and academics studying in the United States. Until the process was complete, he said, student records that had been purged from a federal database in recent weeks would be restored, along with their legal status. A senior Department of Homeland Security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the students whose legal status was restored on Friday could still very well have it terminated in the future, along with their visas. The changes on Friday came amid a wave of individual lawsuits filed by students who have said they were notified that their legal right to study in the United States was rescinded, often with minimal explanation. In some cases, students had minor traffic violations or other infractions. But in other cases, there appeared to be no obvious cause for the revocations.

"Dozens of countries have called for a moratorium on seabed mining, and have urged restraint until an international authority agrees on rules for the practice.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Dozens of countries have called for a moratorium on seabed mining, and have urged restraint until an international authority agrees on rules for the practice. By Max Bearak Global energy and climate policy reporter China’s foreign ministry said on Friday that an executive order President Trump signed a day earlier to accelerate the permitting process for seabed mining in international waters “violates international law and harms the overall interests of the international community.” The BBC earlier reported the remarks by a foreign ministry spokesman, Guo Jiakun. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment. With the notable exception of the United States, nearly every country in the world is party to a treaty on marine and maritime activities that went into force in 1994, called the Law of the Sea Convention. That the United States has never ratified the treaty is in part what allowed Mr. Trump to unilaterally decide that the government could issue permits for mining the seabed in areas beyond American territorial jurisdiction. The White House has argued that extracting critical minerals such as cobalt and nickel from nodules on the ocean floor is crucial to its supply of metals that go into a plethora of advanced technologies. On Friday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the agency that will be tasked with issuing seabed mining permits, said the Trump administration had unlocked “the next gold rush.” Dozens of countries have called for a moratorium on seabed mining, and even those, like China, who have been keen to see seabed mining take place, have urged restraint until the International Seabed Authority, an agency created under the treaty, agrees on rules for how companies can go about extracting minerals from the deep sea. Many scientists see deep-sea mining as environmentally risky. It has never been done at commercial scale before, and the deep sea is one of the planet’s least understood ecosystems.

"Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was elected in 2016. She spent much of her earlier career working on behalf of low-income people and marginalized groups.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Wisconsin Judge Arrested Advertisement Supported by Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was elected in 2016. She spent much of her earlier career working on behalf of low-income people and marginalized groups. By Julie Bosman The Wisconsin judge who was arrested on Friday morning on charges of obstructing immigration enforcement spent most of her legal career working on behalf of low-income people and marginalized groups. Federal authorities arrested the judge, Hannah C. Dugan of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, on suspicion that she “intentionally misdirected federal agents away from” an immigrant being pursued by federal authorities, Kash Patel, the F.B.I. director, wrote on social media. The authorities said that earlier this month, Judge Dugan directed an undocumented immigrant through a side door in her courtroom while the agents waited in a public hallway to apprehend him. A statement issued on behalf of Judge Dugan late Friday stated that she “will defend herself vigorously and looks forward to being exonerated.” She has hired a former federal prosecutor to represent her, the statement said, and “has committed herself to the rule of law and the principles of due process for her entire career as a lawyer and a judge.” Judge Dugan, widely known in progressive circles in Milwaukee, was elected by a wide margin in 2016, beating an incumbent appointee of Scott Walker, the Republican former governor of Wisconsin. Judge Dugan was unopposed for re-election in 2022. Her current term expires in 2028. In 2023, she dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Republican Party of Wisconsin that argued a get-out-the-vote effort in Milwaukee violated the law. Judge Dugan, 65, graduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School in 1987 and took a job at Legal Action of Wisconsin, a group that provides free legal services. She worked as a lawyer specializing in housing, public benefits and Social Security cases, and was the coordinator of the organization’s pro bono attorney program from 1990 to 1994, according to her LinkedIn page.

By Alex Lemonides By Shane GoldmacherRuth Igielnik and Camille Baker Voters believe President Trump is overreaching with his aggressive efforts to expand executive power, and they have deep doubts about some of the signature pieces of his agenda, a New York Times/Siena College poll found. The turbulent early months of Mr. Trump’s administration are seen as “chaotic” and “scary” by majorities of voters — even many who approve of the job he is doing. Voters do not view him as understanding the problems in their daily lives and have soured on his leadership as he approaches his 100th day in office. [Nate Cohn looks at President Trump’s polling numbers from four different perspectives.] Mr. Trump’s approval rating sits at 42 percent. His standing is historically low for a president this early in a term, but it is in line with his stubborn unpopularity, which did not prevent him from sweeping the battleground states in last year’s election. Now, however, voters express dimming confidence about Mr. Trump’s handling of some of the top issues that propelled him back to the White House, including the economy and immigration, even as most Americans support deportations. Only 43 percent said they approved of how he has managed the economy this term, a serious erosion on an issue long seen as a strength. [See all the latest Trump approval polls in our polling tracker.] The president’s pursuit of widespread tariffs — which has caused stock-market drops and gyrations — was opposed by 55 percent of voters, including 63 percent of independents. Taken together, the survey’s findings show that any second-term honeymoon for Mr. Trump is over. His approval rating among crucial independent voters is now at a woeful 29 percent.

They see the start of his term as “scary” and “chaotic.” And while it’s still early, they disapprove of his handling of many issues. By Shane Goldmacher President Trump is approaching the 100-day mark of his second term with historically low levels of support and growing questions from voters about his use of power to advance his agenda, according to the latest poll from The New York Times and Siena College. His approval rating is 42 percent, low for a president who just took office, and he shows early signs of erosion on a signature strength: the economy. Mr. Trump’s base of Republican support remains resilient and solidly behind him. But he faces united opposition from Democratic voters and skepticism from independent ones. Here are five takeaways: Perhaps the most notable finding from the poll is that voters see Mr. Trump as overreaching in his first three months. Over and over, voters said he had “gone too far.” Looking at all the ways he has changed the nation’s political and economic systems, 54 percent said he had “gone too far” — twice as many as said he had been “about right.” But voters also applied that label on several policies that he has tried to sell, including tariffs, immigration enforcement and cuts to the federal work force. Majorities of voters agreed that Mr. Trump had gone too far on all three issues.

By Julian E. Barnes Reporting from Washington Pakistan’s defense minister on Friday declared his country’s innocence in a terror attack that killed 26 people this week in disputed Kashmir territory controlled by India, and said that an international investigation into the attack was needed. In an interview, the minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, said that the country was “ready to cooperate” with “any investigation which is conducted by international inspectors.” The minister’s remarks appeared to be aimed at defusing tensions with India, after armed militants attacked a tourist group on Tuesday near Pahalgam, a town in the southern part of Kashmir. It was the deadliest terror attack on Indian-administered land in years. In the days since, India has moved quickly to take steps against Pakistan, which also controls part of Kashmir, including by closing border crossings and suspending a crucial water pact. Officials in India have said they suspect the involvement of at least two Pakistani nationals in the attack. Mr. Asif said that India had used the aftermath of the terror attack as a pretext to suspend the water treaty, and for domestic political purposes. India, he said, was taking steps to punish Pakistan “without any proof, without any investigation.” Pakistani officials have asked the Trump administration to mediate the dispute.

"The devices will be remotely wiped “to simplify processes and to reduce burden” of terminating thousands of federal workers before the agency is closed.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","U.S.A.I.D. Advertisement Supported by The devices will be remotely wiped “to simplify processes and to reduce burden” of terminating thousands of federal workers before the agency is closed. By Karoun DemirjianGreg Kendall-Ball and Edward Wong Reporting from Washington Staff members being fired from the federal agency responsible for distributing foreign aid will be able to keep their government-issued electronic devices when it closes its doors this summer, according to an internal email, copies of which were shared with The New York Times. In the email, sent to employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Trump administration officials said that iPhones, iPads and laptops would “be remotely wiped and marked as disposed.” The directive, the email stated, was adopted “to simplify processes and to reduce burden” of terminating the thousands of direct hires and consultants who worked for the agency before it was slated to be closed this summer, its remaining functions to be folded into the State Department. Federal employees are typically required to return their government-issued devices, in part to reduce the security risk of leaving potentially sensitive information with workers whose service has been terminated. The letter stipulates that devices will not be marked as “disposed” until they have been remotely wiped. It makes no request that the employees dispose of the devices. There is also no clear deadline stipulated in the email, which says merely that devices will be remotely sanitized “on or around the employee Reduction in Force (RIF) date.” Staff based in the United States have been told that their employment will end by Aug. 15, which is also the date by which U.S.A.I.D.’s foreign service officers are expected to return to the United States. The email also says that the administration will reach out to U.S.A.I.D. contractors who were fired weeks ago to let them know how to wipe their devices remotely. With the planned closure of the agency, it was not clear what the government might have done with the returned devices. But their collective value is potentially significant. Before President Trump returned to office in January and began cutting the work force, U.S.A.I.D. had over 10,000 employees. Though it was not immediately clear how many devices employees were issued, the value of the devices could reach into the millions of dollars. Press officers for U.S.A.I.D. and the State Department did not immediately return requests for comment. Karoun Demirjian is a breaking news reporter for The Times.

"The authorities said a man used a chain saw to destroy more than a dozen trees in downtown Los Angeles, an attack that saddened and rattled residents and city leaders.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The authorities said a man used a chain saw to destroy more than a dozen trees in downtown Los Angeles, an attack that saddened and rattled residents and city leaders. By Jesus Jiménez Reporting from Los Angeles On a busy stretch of Grand Avenue in downtown Los Angeles, three orange-and-white traffic cones sit atop the dirt in grates on the sidewalk where three trees once stood. It’s not a construction site. It’s a kind of crime scene. The three trees were some of the victims of one man’s bizarre eight-day tree-killing spree that destroyed more than a dozen mature trees in and around downtown Los Angeles, blocks from City Hall and Frank Gehry’s Walt Disney Concert Hall. The man, the authorities said, roamed the streets in the middle of the night and used a chain saw to cut elm, ficus and other trees. Some were sawed right across the middle. Others were left with bare branches. Officials said the damage totaled $347,000. He was apprehended on Earth Day. Downtown Los Angeles is one of those urban American places that has, in a sense, seen it all. There have been violent attacks that made headlines, such as a shooting at a Target in December that injured two security guards. There is homelessness, with tents and encampments spread across sidewalks and doorways. It had emptied out during the pandemic but has experienced a revival as tourists and residents flock to popular spots like Grand Central Market. Downtown remains a hub of protests and gatherings, including a parade last year celebrating the Dodgers’ World Series victory. But the sight of butchered trees, some of the few spots of greenery in a landscape of concrete and skyscrapers, has rattled and saddened Angelenos far beyond downtown. The case sparked an intense manhunt, prompting the police to ask the public for tips and scour surveillance footage. The mayor, the district attorney and city leaders have weighed in. There have been news conferences calling for increased investments in public safety. After the wildfires that destroyed thousands of homes and upended thousands of lives three months ago, some residents have wondered: What’s next? We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

An internal Justice Department memo from Ms. Bondi said that the change was necessary to safeguard “classified, privileged and other sensitive information” — a far broader set of government secrets than is protected by the criminal code, which focuses primarily on making it illegal to share classified information. From his first days in the White House in 2017, President Trump has complained bitterly about leaks of all kinds. Mr. Trump himself faced criminal indictment for allegedly mishandling classified information after he left the White House, in a case that was ultimately dismissed. Given Mr. Trump’s confrontational approach to the press, First Amendment advocates have long expected his administration to rescind Biden-era protections for journalists. But the vague phrasing of the new memo at times appeared to call for more than simply restoring past policy. The Bondi memo said federal prosecutors “will continue to employ procedural protections to limit the use of compulsory legal process to obtain information from or records of members of the news media.” In the past, such protections have included requiring senior-level Justice Department approvals before seeking court orders for such information. The memo did not describe the protections. The Justice Department, Ms. Bondi wrote, “will not tolerate unauthorized disclosures that undermine President Trump’s policies, victimize government agencies, and cause harm to the American people.” Even if the Trump administration were to pursue leak investigations beyond the traditional ambit of classified information in order to get a warrant, prosecutors would still have to convince judges that a crime might have been committed. Bruce D. Brown, the president of the advocacy group Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said that some of the most important reporting in U.S. history had come from reporters using confidential sources. “Strong protections for journalists serve the American public by safeguarding the free flow of information,” he said. The Justice Department has typically shied away from prosecuting journalists for merely possessing classified information. When prosecutors have sought reporters’ data, it has nearly always been part of an effort to identify and prosecute the person who gave the reporters the information. But the main criminal statute that governs such cases dates back to World War I, and is broadly worded. The Bondi memo says that Justice Department officials, when deciding whether to use court orders aimed at journalists, will consider whether there are “reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has occurred and the information sought is essential to a successful prosecution,” and whether prosecutors have made all other reasonable attempts to get the information. Prosecutors must also consider whether “absent a threat to national security, the integrity of the investigation or bodily harm,” the government has pursued negotiations with the journalist in question.

"An order signed by President Trump last month was aimed at stripping collective bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands of federal workers.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by An order signed by President Trump last month was aimed at stripping collective bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands of federal workers. By Chris Cameron Reporting from Washington A federal judge in Washington blocked President Trump from ending collective bargaining with unions representing federal workers, stymying a component of Mr. Trump’s sweeping effort to strip civil servants of job protections and assert more control over the federal bureaucracy. Judge Paul L. Friedman of the Federal District Court in Washington ruled in favor of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents tens of thousands of federal workers across the government. Without including an opinion explaining his decision, Judge Friedman ruled that the executive order from Mr. Trump was unlawful, and he granted a temporary injunction blocking its implementation while the case proceeded. “An opinion explaining the court’s reasoning will be issued within the next few days,” Judge Friedman wrote in the two-page order. The order, if implemented, would strip collective bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands of federal workers, effectively banning them from joining unions. Those unions have been a major obstacle in Mr. Trump’s effort to slash the size of the federal work force and reshape the government. With every stroke of the pen from Mr. Trump enacting new orders aimed at tightening control over the federal bureaucracy, federal worker unions have responded with lawsuits, winning at least temporary reprieves for some fired federal workers and blocking efforts to dismantle portions of the government. Mr. Trump had framed his order stripping workers of labor protections as critical to protect national security. But the union noted that it targeted agencies across the government, some of which had no obvious national security portfolio, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency. “The administration’s own issuances show that the president’s exclusions are not based on national security concerns,” the suit said, “but, instead, a policy objective of making federal employees easier to fire and political animus against federal sector unions.” Chris Cameron is a Times reporter covering Washington, focusing on breaking news and the Trump administration.

"Even as Musk’s work at the Department of Government Efficiency appeared to consume him, his top adviser created a set of companies named Red Planet I, II and III.",2025-04-25,"The New York Times","Wisconsin Judge Arrested Advertisement Newsletter Even as Musk’s work at the Department of Government Efficiency appeared to consume him, his top adviser created a set of companies named Red Planet I, II and III. By Theodore Schleifer Elon Musk is leaving his full-time Washington assignment next month to try to save Tesla (which has seen its stock battered), to keep up with SpaceX (which is positioned to do big business with the Trump administration) and to chart a new course for xAI, which he just combined with X itself. He’s a busy guy. So what’s another company — or three? Two months ago, even as Musk appeared consumed by his work at yet another job, at the Department of Government Efficiency, his top adviser, Jared Birchall, quietly created an intriguing-sounding set of limited-liability companies in Texas, whose existence has not been previously reported. Their names: Red Planet I, II and III. For the world’s richest man, who is pursuing an elaborate, decades-long plan to colonize Mars, this seemed no idle corporate filing. When Musk bought Twitter, after all, he formed three holding companies (X Holdings I, II and III) to execute the transaction. So, is he planning to buy Mars? Birchall hasn’t returned my requests for comment since I learned of the LLCs a few weeks ago. But he doesn’t typically take actions like this without his boss’s direction. He registered them on Feb. 25, listing himself as the manager of each and using an Austin address that other Musk entities have used. Still, it is surprising to see Musk take this step now, when he has so much on his plate and is already facing pressure to do less, not more. On a Tesla earnings call last week, he said he would substantially reduce the amount of time he spent on DOGE to spend more time on the car company, whose quarterly revenue is way down from a year ago.

"The pardon of Paul Walczak, who had been convicted of tax crimes, comes as the president uses clemency to reward allies and swipe at perceived enemies.",2025-04-26,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The pardon of Paul Walczak, who had been convicted of tax crimes, comes as the president uses clemency to reward allies and swipe at perceived enemies. By Kenneth P. Vogel and Andrew Duehren Reporting from Washington President Trump has pardoned a Florida health care executive whose mother played a role in trying to expose the contents of Ashley Biden’s diary. The pardon of the executive, Paul Walczak, was signed privately on Wednesday and posted on the Justice Department’s website on Friday. It came less than two weeks after he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered to pay nearly $4.4 million in restitution, for tax crimes that prosecutors said were used to finance a lavish lifestyle, including the purchase of a yacht. Mr. Walczak’s mother, Elizabeth Fago, who was also involved in the health care industry in Florida, is a longtime Republican donor and fund-raiser who played a role in a surreptitious effort to help Mr. Trump by undermining Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the 2020 presidential election. During the campaign, Ms. Fago was contacted by a man who was in possession of a diary kept by Mr. Biden’s daughter, Ashley, as she recovered from addiction, The New York Times previously reported. When first told of the diary, Ms. Fago said she thought it would help Mr. Trump’s chances of winning the election if it was made public, two people familiar with the matter later told The Times. The man, Robert Kurlander, circulated the diary at a fund-raiser at Ms. Fago’s house in Jupiter, Fla., in September 2020. Ms. Fago’s daughter passed along a tip about the diary to Project Veritas, a conservative group that had become a favorite of Mr. Trump’s. Project Veritas later paid $40,000 to Mr. Kurlander and an associate, Aimee Harris, for the diary. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"President Donald Trump is weighing in on a school mascot dispute at Massapequa High School, where some parents are upset that a Chiefs mascot and logo must go under a state rule.",2025-04-26,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by President Donald Trump is weighing in on a school mascot dispute at Massapequa High School, where some parents are upset that a Chiefs mascot and logo must go under a state rule. By Ed Shanahan Federal education officials said on Friday that they had opened a civil rights inquiry into whether New York State could withhold state money from a Long Island school district that has refused to follow a state requirement and drop its Native American mascot. The announcement came shortly after President Trump expressed his support for the district, in Massapequa, N.Y., in its fight against complying with a state Board of Regents requirement that all districts abandon mascots that appropriate Native American culture or risk losing state funding. The Massapequa district, whose “Chiefs” logo depicts an illustrated side profile of a Native American man in a feathered headdress, is one of several that have resisted making a change. The name of the town, a middle-class swath of the South Shore where most residents voted for Mr. Trump in the November election, was derived from the Native American word “Marspeag” or “Mashpeag,” which means “great water land.” In announcing the investigation, Linda McMahon, the education secretary, said that her department would “not stand by as the state of New York attempts to rewrite history and deny the town of Massapequa the right to celebrate its heritage in its schools.” JP O’Hare, a spokesman for the state Education Department, said in a statement that state education officials had not been contacted by the federal government about the matter.

"A reinterpretation of the Hatch Act announced by the administration lets officials wear campaign paraphernalia like MAGA hats, and removes an independent board’s role in policing violations.",2025-04-26,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by A reinterpretation of the Hatch Act announced by the administration lets officials wear campaign paraphernalia like MAGA hats, and removes an independent board’s role in policing violations. By Eileen Sullivan Eileen Sullivan covers changes to the federal work force under President Trump. She reported from Washington. The Trump administration moved on Friday to weaken federal prohibitions on government employees showing support for President Trump while at work, embracing the notion that they should be allowed to wear campaign paraphernalia and removing an independent review board’s role in policing violations. The Office of Special Counsel, an agency involved in enforcing the restrictions, announced the changes to the interpretation of the Hatch Act, a Depression-era law devised to ensure that the federal work force operates free of political influence or coercion. The revisions, a resurrection of rules that Mr. Trump rolled out at the end of his first term but that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. repealed, could allow for the startling sight of government officials sporting Trump-Vance buttons or “Make America Great Again” hats. Critics have said the law was already largely toothless, and officials in the first Trump administration were routinely accused of violating it, with little punishment meted out. And the changes do not roll back Hatch Act restrictions entirely, but do so in a way that uniquely benefits Mr. Trump: Visible support for candidates and their campaigns in the future is still banned, but support for the current officeholder is not. The move may not violate the law, because it will not influence the outcome of an election, experts say. But it threatens to further politicize the government’s professional work force, which Mr. Trump has been seeking to bend to his will as he tests the bounds of executive power. “This is a really dark day,” Kathleen Clark, a professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis and a government ethics lawyer, said in an interview on Friday. A president should work to ensure that the public knows the government is for everyone, she said. “When you go into a Social Security office, if they’re still open, you will be treated the same whether you voted for the current president or not,” she said, referring to the government downsizing efforts since Mr. Trump returned to the Oval Office.

"The Trump administration threatened to withhold federal funding from states that did not enforce its interpretation of civil rights law.",2025-04-26,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by The Trump administration threatened to withhold federal funding from states that did not enforce its interpretation of civil rights law. By Sarah Mervosh A coalition of 19 states sued the Trump administration on Friday over its threat to withhold federal funding from states and districts with certain diversity programs in their public schools. The lawsuit was filed in federal court by the attorneys general in California, New York, Illinois, Minnesota and other Democratic-leaning states, who argue that the Trump administration’s demand is illegal. The lawsuit centers on an April 3 memo the Trump administration sent to states, requiring them to certify that they do not use certain diversity, equity and inclusion programs that the administration has said are illegal. States that did not certify risked losing federal funding for low-income students. Rob Bonta, the California attorney general, said at a news conference on Friday that the Trump administration had distorted federal civil rights law to force states to abandon legal diversity programs. “California hasn’t and won’t capitulate. Our sister states won’t capitulate,” Mr. Bonta said, adding that the Trump administration’s D.E.I. order was vague and impractical to enforce, and that D.E.I. programs are “entirely legal” under civil rights law. The Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday evening. The administration has argued that certain diversity programs in schools violate federal civil rights law, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs that receive federal funding. It has based its argument on the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling ending the use of race in college admissions, arguing that the decision applies to the use of race in education more broadly. The administration has not offered a specific list of D.E.I. initiatives it deems illegal. But it has suggested that efforts to provide targeted academic support or counseling to specific groups of students amount to illegal segregation. And it has argued that lessons on concepts such as white privilege or structural racism, which posits that racism is embedded in social institutions, are discriminatory. The lawsuit came a day after the Trump administration was ordered to pause any enforcement of its April 3 memo, in separate federal lawsuits brought by teachers’ unions and the N.A.A.C.P., among others. Mr. Bonta said that the lawsuit by the 19 states brought forward separate claims and represented the “strong and unique interest” of states to ensure that billions of federal dollars appropriated by Congress reach students. “We have different claims that we think are very strong claims,” he said. Loss of federal funding would be catastrophic for students, said Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, an adversary of President Trump who previously won a civil fraud case against him. She noted that school districts in Buffalo and Rochester rely on federal funds for nearly 20 percent of their revenue and said she was suing to “uphold our nation’s civil rights laws and protect our schools and the students who rely on them.” Sarah Mervosh covers education for The Times, focusing on K-12 schools.

In a brief order issued from Federal District Court in the Western District of Louisiana, Judge Terry A. Doughty questioned why the administration had sent the child — known in court papers only as V.M.L. — to Honduras with her mother even though her father had sought in an emergency petition on Thursday to stop the girl from being sent abroad. “The government contends that this is all OK because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her,” wrote Judge Doughty, a conservative Trump appointee. “But the court doesn’t know that.” Asserting that “it is illegal and unconstitutional to deport” a U.S. citizen, Judge Doughty set a hearing for May 16 to explore his “strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.” The case of V.M.L., which was reported earlier by Politico, is the latest challenge to the legality of several aspects of President Trump’s aggressive deportation efforts. The administration has already been blocked by seven federal judges in courts across the country from removing Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members to El Salvador under a rarely invoked wartime statute. It has also created an uproar by wrongfully deporting a Maryland man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to El Salvador and so far refusing to work to bring him back.

Now, they are despised by many — including those who drive them. By Heather Knight Reporting from Mill Valley, Calif. In the parking lots of Mill Valley, Calif., mysterious index cards have surfaced on the windshields of Tesla Model Xs and Model 3s. “Stop Elon,” they urge in teal script. “Dump your Tesla.” A few years ago, buying a Tesla in Mill Valley meant that you had money, but were not overly showy. It meant you were a progressive environmentalist who had style. It meant you belonged. Ten miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge, tucked into the lush, green hills of Marin County, Mill Valley is an idyllic place to live — for those who are wealthy and liberal. And for years, Teslas were “the Ferrari for the Patagonia-wearing crowd,” said Nathan Ballard, a political consultant who lives in Mill Valley and owns a black Tesla Model S. But the sleek electric cars have come to mean something else entirely for Mill Valley residents since the presidential election. Activists elsewhere have set fire to Tesla charging stations, scrawled swastikas into Tesla vehicles and sprayed graffiti on dealerships. The battle raging in Mill Valley is something quieter: an internal war within the minds and hearts of Tesla owners, their environmental ethos clashing with their rage toward Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive.

"As colleges face increased scrutiny from the federal government, they are taking diverging approaches in choosing commencement keynotes.",2025-04-26,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by As colleges face increased scrutiny from the federal government, they are taking diverging approaches in choosing commencement keynotes. By Mitch Smith The federal government has investigated prominent universities, paused grant funding and revoked student visas. And still, it is graduation season on American campuses, where thousands of young adults will soon don four-sided caps and celebrate years of hard work while “Pomp and Circumstance” plays on repeat. Like always, college administrators have selected a range of keynote speakers to impart wisdom (and, they hope, avoid controversy) at commencement ceremonies. A year after pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated at many graduations, and amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on higher education, colleges are walking a tightrope in picking speakers. Administrators want to find someone who is interesting and accomplished and perhaps has ties to their school, but also who is unlikely to set off protests or say something that would bring unwelcome attention. This year’s list includes many of the usual suspects: governors, cabinet secretaries and political commentators with well-known views on the most divisive issues of the day. It also includes scores of athletes and celebrities from outside the partisan fray. Here is a look at some of the others, including a Muppet, who are scheduled to address graduates in the days and weeks ahead: Nothing seems likelier to boost graduation attendance than having a celebrity onstage to shake hands with graduates. This year, plenty have signed up. The rapper Snoop Dogg will speak to graduates of the University of Southern California’s business school, and Jon M. Chu, a film director, will speak at that institution’s universitywide commencement. Steve Carell of “The Office” will be at Northwestern University, and Sandra Oh of “Grey’s Anatomy” will headline Dartmouth College’s ceremony. Elizabeth Banks of “The Hunger Games” will speak at the University of Pennsylvania. The singer Usher will be honored at Emory University’s graduation.

For nearly five months a year, when temperatures are often below freezing in Calgary, Mr. James and his wife spend languid days by the pool, hike sweeping canyons and enjoy live music beneath the stars at the local saloon. But in recent months — as President Trump has announced a 25 percent tariff on certain Canadian goods and threatened the nation’s sovereignty — they and other Canadians are reconsidering their future in Palm Springs. The trend is part of a broader slump in tourism as international travelers say they feel unwelcome in the United States. In Palm Springs, some are selling or abandoning plans to buy vacation homes. Others are canceling trips or cutting their winter visits short. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

Jouppi knowingly tried to fly into a dry community with a six-pack on board. Now, he may lose his plane. By Hank Sanders A six-pack of beer at the corner store will generally set you back $10 or $15, maybe a tad more. But even a small batch of the most artisanal locally brewed I.P.A. isn’t $95,000. But that’s how much a cargo of beer could cost Kenneth J. Jouppi, 82, of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, who piloted charter flights in Alaska until around 2014. On April 18, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that he could be forced to forfeit his $95,000 plane as a penalty for trying to fly alcohol into a dry Alaskan community that does not allow for the importation, sale or possession of alcohol, according to court records. In April 2012, a state trooper stopped Mr. Jouppi before his plane took off from Fairbanks, Alaska, after the trooper said that he saw Mr. Jouppi “opening and closing boxes” that contained beer, according to court records. The trooper said “it would have been impossible” for Mr. Jouppi not to see at least one six-pack out of 72 beers that were on the plane. Mr. Jouppi denied knowing that the beer was on board. (Mr. Jouppi could not recall, and the court papers did not specify, the brand of beer.) We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

By Eduardo MedinaMiles J. Herszenhorn and Eryn Davis When Karl Molden, a sophomore at Harvard University from Vienna, learned that the Trump administration had abruptly restored thousands of international students’ ability to legally study in the United States, he said he did not feel reassured. After all, immigration officials have insisted that they could still terminate students’ legal status, even in the face of legal challenges, and the administration has characterized the matter as only a temporary reprieve. “They shouldn’t tempt us into thinking that the administration will stop harassing us,” Mr. Molden said. “They will try to find other ways.” Mr. Molden is not alone in his worry. The dramatic shift from the administration on Friday came after scores of international students filed lawsuits saying that their legal right to study in the United States had been rescinded, often with minimal explanation. In some cases, students had minor traffic violations or other infractions. In others, there appeared to be no obvious reason for the revocations. After learning that Immigration and Customs Enforcement had deleted their records from the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, many students sued to try to save their status. That prompted a flurry of emergency orders by judges that blocked the changes. Students and their immigration lawyers said on Saturday that they were relieved for the temporary reprieve, but emphasized that it was just that — temporary.

Her arrest has raised several questions. By Isabelle Taft F.B.I. agents arrested on Friday a Milwaukee judge accused of obstructing justice by directing an undocumented immigrant out of her courtroom through a side door while federal immigration agents waited in a hallway to arrest him. The arrest of the judge, Hannah C. Dugan, quickly drew condemnation from Democratic leaders and prompted protests in the Wisconsin city. But the U.S. attorney general, Pam Bondi, defended the move, saying Judge Dugan’s arrest sent a “strong message” to judges that the Trump administration will prosecute them if they obstruct justice by “escorting a criminal defendant out a back door.” And after the arrest, the F.B.I. director, Kash Patel, posted a photo of her in handcuffs on X, adding, “No one is above the law.” On Tuesday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Judge Dugan from her position as a circuit judge while the case against her moves forward. In a two-page order, the court wrote that the suspension was necessary “in order to uphold the public’s confidence in the courts of this state.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The four-day operation came as the Trump administration has sought to enlist local authorities in an immigration crackdown.",2025-04-26,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The four-day operation came as the Trump administration has sought to enlist local authorities in an immigration crackdown. By Hamed Aleaziz Reporting from Washington U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, along with state law enforcement officials, arrested about 780 immigrants in Florida in an operation this week, according to ICE data obtained by The New York Times. The operation began on Monday and targeted undocumented immigrants with final deportation orders, according to an ICE official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. The officers picked up more than 275 migrants with final removal orders, the data showed. ABC News and Fox News earlier reported news of the arrests, which took place over four days. It was the latest move by the Trump administration to seek to accelerate deportations of undocumented immigrants, which have so far been well below the administration’s goals. Since President Trump took office, ICE officials have worked with various federal agencies to conduct raids across the United States. The effort this week in Florida was the first to be conducted as part of a formal arrangement with state law enforcement known as a 287(g) agreement, according to the official. The Trump administration has sought to recruit local authorities to help in immigration operations in an effort to speed deportations. The administration has resumed collateral arrests during such operations, which allows officers to pick up migrants who were not initially targeted but were around an individual who was sought by ICE. Generally, people must have received an order of removal from an immigration judge before they are deported, a process that can take weeks or stretch into years. But since the start of 2024, 70 percent of these removal orders were issued to someone who did not attend their hearing before a judge, according to a Times analysis of court records. “It’s going to break up families,” said Tessa Petit, the executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said of the arrests this week. “And that is not the welcoming state that Florida has been for immigrants for decades.” Given the scale of the operation, Ms. Petit said, there is a chance that many of those arrested were in the country on some sort of legal status and did not possess criminal records. The raids represented the biggest escalation of immigration enforcement in Florida since Mr. Trump took office, Ms. Petit said, adding that they were much more reflective of the president’s mass deportation promises. ICE operations in communities take an extensive amount of research and surveillance. They also require many officers, which is why the Trump administration has pulled in several other law enforcement agencies. Trump administration officials have increasingly turned to warning undocumented immigrants to leave the country. “President Trump and I have a clear message to those in our country illegally: LEAVE NOW,” said Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, in a statement on Monday. “If you do not self-deport, we will hunt you down, arrest you and deport you.” Orlando Mayorquín , Albert Sun and Miriam Jordan contributed reporting.

By Adeel Hassan A former employee of Walt Disney World who hacked into menus used by its restaurants and edited them — changing prices, adding profanity and altering listed allergens — was sentenced to three years in prison by a federal judge in Florida this week. None of the changes, including falsified information about food allergens that could have been harmful to visitors, ever appeared before the public, according to court records. The menu alterations were caught and court records show that none of the changes ever reached the printing stage. The former employee, Michael Scheuer of Winter Garden, Fla., was sentenced on Wednesday in federal court in Orlando, Fla., after pleading guilty in January to one count of computer fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. Mr. Scheuer, 40, was ordered to pay restitution of about $620,000 to Disney and $70,000 to the unidentified software company that provides Disney with its menu creation program. While court documents do not mention Disney World, menus that were entered into evidence in Mr. Scheuer’s case are from the hundreds of restaurants at Walt Disney World in Orlando. Disney World representatives did not respond to messages seeking comment. In early June 2024, Mr. Scheuer had returned from paternity leave, court documents show. A few days later, he had an argument with a supervisor about menu creation, according to the documents, and he was told that he would be suspended.

"Even as Republicans suffer setbacks in their fight to overturn a loss in a State Supreme Court race, judges have shown a striking willingness to entertain the long-shot challenges.",2025-04-27,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by News Analysis Even as Republicans suffer setbacks in their fight to overturn a loss in a State Supreme Court race, judges have shown a striking willingness to entertain the long-shot challenges. By Nick Corasaniti and Eduardo Medina Nick Corasaniti reported from New York, and Eduardo Medina from Raleigh, N.C. For months, Republicans in North Carolina have tried to do what President Trump and his allies could not in 2020: overturn an election that did not go their way. What began as a sprawling effort to throw out 65,000 votes from the state’s Supreme Court election in November has shrunk to a legal skirmish over a small fraction of those ballots. But even as Republicans’ path to victory has narrowed, the final outcome still hangs in the balance. And even if the Democratic candidate’s victory is not reversed, the battle may have sketched a blueprint for overturning future elections. Never before, legal experts from both parties say, has a losing candidate gained so much legal traction in trying to nullify votes cast by people who followed every instruction given to them, both when they registered to vote and when they submitted their ballots. Federal and state judges have shown a willingness to entertain Republican challenges of votes in Democratic-leaning areas that focused on technicalities and sought to reinterpret voting laws long after Election Day. The episode, which in many ways is an acceleration of the right-wing movement challenging the 2020 presidential election, could encourage election challenges from candidates who lose fairly but are inclined to fight the outcome. More races could be subject to litigation after the polls close, as candidates try to wipe out votes with help from friendly courts and deep-pocketed legal campaigns. “The stakes are far greater than one seat on the State Supreme Court,” said Bob Orr, who served on the North Carolina Supreme Court as a Republican but has since left the party to become unaffiliated. He likened some of the recent judicial decisions clearing a path for votes to be tossed out retroactively to “opening up a Pandora’s box.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Stephanie Saul and Alan Blinder The Trump administration’s swift initial rollout of orders seeking more control over universities left schools thunderstruck. Fearing retribution from a president known to retaliate against his enemies, most leaders in higher education responded in February with silence. But after weeks of witnessing the administration freeze billions in federal funding, demand changes to policies and begin investigations, a broad coalition of university leaders publicly opposing those moves is taking root. The most visible evidence yet was a statement last week signed by more than 400 campus leaders opposing what they saw as the administration’s assault on academia. Although organizations of colleges and administrators regularly conduct meetings on a wide range of issues, the statement by the American Association of Colleges and Universities was an unusual show of unity considering the wide cross-section of interests it included: Ivy League institutions and community colleges, public flagship schools and Jesuit universities, regional schools and historically Black colleges. “We speak with one voice against the unprecedented government overreach and political interference now endangering American higher education,” the statement said. Although it contained no concrete action, and what’s next was unclear, the collective stance reflected a group more galvanized than ever to resist. “When we are teaming up with higher ed across the board, it’s more than just about what the elite think,” Richard K. Lyons, chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, said in an interview after the school signed on. “At some level, that really disparate, wide-angle, wonderful group of colleges and universities that signed the message, I find quite heartening.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The cases are the latest test of the president’s expansive claims of executive power.",2025-04-27,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The cases are the latest test of the president’s expansive claims of executive power. By Tony Romm Reporting from Washington Somewhere along a roughly 7,500-mile journey that begins in Shenzhen, China, there are 19 shipments bound for Rick Woldenberg, the chief executive of Learning Resources, an educational toy company in Vernon Hills, Ill. Eventually, the containers of puzzle cards, child binoculars and other products will reach a port in the United States, and Mr. Woldenberg will face a difficult and expensive decision. He can pay the sky-high tariffs that President Trump has imposed on most foreign goods, or forgo at least some of the much-needed inventory, perhaps imperiling his bottom line. Mr. Woldenberg expects to do a bit of both. But he has also opted for a more aggressive course of action, joining a growing roster of opponents now legally challenging Mr. Trump’s ability to issue some of the tariffs in the first place. Nearly four weeks into a costly global trade war with no end in sight, Mr. Trump is facing a barrage of lawsuits from state officials, small businesses and even once-allied political groups, all contending that the president cannot sidestep Congress and tax virtually any import at levels to his liking. The lawsuits carry great significance, not just because the tariffs have roiled financial markets and threatened to plunge the United States into a recession. The legal challenges also stand to test Mr. Trump’s claims of expansive presidential power, while illustrating the difficult calculation that his opponents face in deciding whether to fight back and risk retribution. None of the lawsuits filed this month are supported by major business lobbying groups, even though many organizations — including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable — have been sharply critical of the president’s tariffs and lobbied to lessen their impact. The chamber privately debated bringing a lawsuit, but ultimately decided it was “not the best course of action at this time,” said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president of the group.

"New details show that the failures leading up to the midair collision of a regional jet and an Army helicopter were more complex than previously known.",2025-04-27,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by New details show that the failures leading up to the midair collision of a regional jet and an Army helicopter were more complex than previously known. By Kate Kelly and Mark Walker Reporting from Washington It is clear that something went terribly wrong the night of Jan. 29, when an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided with an American Airlines regional jet over the Potomac River near Ronald Reagan National Airport, killing everyone on board the aircraft. But one error did not cause the worst domestic crash in the United States in nearly a quarter-century. Modern aviation is designed to have redundancies and safeguards that prevent a misstep, or even several missteps, from being catastrophic. On Jan. 29, that system collapsed, a New York Times investigation found. Up to now, attention has focused on the Black Hawk’s altitude, which was too high and placed it directly in the jet’s landing path. But The Times uncovered new details showing that the failures were far more complex than previously understood. Here are five takeaways from the investigation: The practice, known as flying under see and avoid rules, works exactly as it sounds. A pilot is meant to see neighboring air traffic, often without assistance from the air traffic controller, and avoid it by hovering in place until the traffic passes or by flying around it in prescribed ways. One benefit of the see-and-avoid system is that it can lighten the controller’s workload during busy periods. But see and avoid has proved problematic, even deadly, in recent decades. It has also been implicated in at least 40 fatal collisions since 2010, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. On the night of the crash, the Black Hawk crew did not execute see and avoid effectively. The pilots either did not detect the specific passenger jet the controller had flagged, or could not pivot to a safer position. The result is that they flew directly into the path of American Airlines Flight 5342 as it tried to land at National Airport. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there are reasons to be optimistic, but also asserted there are “other issues” on which the administration wants to spend its energy.",2025-04-27,"The New York Times","Russia-Ukraine War Advertisement Supported by Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there are reasons to be optimistic, but also asserted there are “other issues” on which the administration wants to spend its energy. By Edward Wong Reporting from Washington Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that the Trump administration will decide this week whether to continue pursuing a negotiated settlement in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or to turn its attention to other matters. This week will be “very important,” Mr. Rubio said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “We have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in or if it’s time to sort of focus on some other issues that are equally if not more important in some cases.” “But we want to see it happen,” he added. “There are reasons to be optimistic, but there are reasons to be realistic of course as well. We’re close, but we’re not close enough.” Mr. Rubio did not give further details of the state of the talks. It was not clear if the timeline he offered was meant to pressure Ukraine and Russia to agree to enter direct discussions toward a deal, or whether President Trump and his aides were seriously considering walking away. In an interview on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” Sergey V. Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, did not suggest any settlement was imminent. “We are ready to reach a deal,” he said. “But there are still some specific points — elements of this deal which need to be fine-tuned.” Russia launched a barrage of missiles and drones at Kyiv last Thursday that killed at least 12 people, prompting unusually sharp criticism from Mr. Trump. Mr. Lavrov said in the interview, which was recorded on the day of the strikes, that Russia still had not agreed to a U.S. proposal for a 30-day full cease-fire that the Ukrainians have said they accepted.

"The Treasury secretary said that the President Trump and Xi Jinping of China have a good relationship but that he was not aware of a call, which Mr. Trump had alluded to last week.",2025-04-27,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The Treasury secretary said that the President Trump and Xi Jinping of China have a good relationship but that he was not aware of a call, which Mr. Trump had alluded to last week. By Alan Rappeport and Jonathan Swan Reporting from Washington Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that he did not know if President Trump had spoken to President Xi Jinping of China, casting further doubt on Mr. Trump’s recent suggestion that Mr. Xi had called him. Mr. Bessent’s comments, made on ABC’s “This Week,” come as the United States and China are locked in a trade war that is destabilizing the world economy and rattling global markets. The secretary attempted to ease concerns about trade tensions with China and other countries, insisting that the administration was in talks with various nations and acknowledging that the tariffs it has imposed on Chinese goods were not sustainable. But it appears that communication with China has been minimal. “I don’t know if President Trump has spoken with President Xi,” Mr. Bessent said when pressed by the host, Martha Raddatz, about Mr. Trump’s statements that the two leaders had spoken about trade. “I know they have a very good relationship and a lot of respect for each other.” The Treasury secretary is traditionally the American official who leads economic talks between the United States and China and would be expected to know if Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi had engaged in such discussions. In an interview with Time last week, Mr. Trump said Mr. Xi had called him, though he declined to say when, and asserted that his team was in active talks with China on a trade deal.

"The children, 4 and 7, were put on a plane with their mother, who was deported. The family’s lawyer said the mother was given no choice but to take her children, which the Trump administration denied.",2025-04-27,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The children, 4 and 7, were put on a plane with their mother, who was deported. The family’s lawyer said the mother was given no choice but to take her children, which the Trump administration denied. By Rachel Nostrant A 4-year-old and a 7-year-old with U.S. citizenship were deported alongside their mother to Honduras last week, the family’s lawyer said, adding to the recent string of American citizens caught in the cross hairs of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. The children and their mother were put on a flight to Honduras on Friday, the same day another child with U.S. citizenship, a 2-year-old girl, was sent to that country with her undocumented mother. Lawyers for both families said the mothers were not given an option to leave their children in the United States before they were deported. In the case of the 2-year-old, whose 11-year-old sibling was also sent to Honduras, a federal judge in Louisiana expressed concern that the administration had deported the American child against the wishes of her father, who remained in the country. But President Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, denied that any American child was deported. Speaking about the 2-year-old’s case on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Mr. Homan said that federal immigration agents gave her mother a choice of whether to be deported with or without her child, and that she had left the country with her daughter at her discretion. The children are from two different families who were living in Louisiana. The mother of the 2-year-old is pregnant, and the 4-year-old, a boy, has a rare form of late-stage cancer, the families’ lawyers said. They said the boy had no access to his medications or his doctors while he was in custody with his 7-year-old sister and mother. The moves come as the Trump administration has ramped up its immigration enforcement and mass deportation efforts. In Florida last week, nearly 800 immigrants were arrested in an operation involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and state law enforcement officials.

"Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s purse contained her driver’s license, government badge, passport and $3,000 in cash when it was swiped from an upscale burger restaurant.",2025-04-27,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s purse contained her driver’s license, government badge, passport and $3,000 in cash when it was swiped from an upscale burger restaurant. By Minho Kim Reporting from Washington Investigators have arrested a person accused of being involved in the theft of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s handbag at an upscale Washington hamburger restaurant last weekend, the Secret Service said Sunday. Matt McCool, a special agent at the Secret Service, said in a statement that the suspect did not seem to have targeted Ms. Noem because of her position. He did not release the suspect’s name, but he described the person as “a serial offender” who had tried to use Ms. Noem’s credit card and gain access to her electronic devices. Ms. Noem’s purse was snatched from underneath her chair on April 20, Easter Sunday, as she dined with her family at The Capital Burger in downtown Washington. The bag contained the secretary’s driver’s license, medication, apartment keys, blank checks, department badge, passport and $3,000 in cash. Ms. Noem’s spokeswoman previously said that the thief had hooked the secretary’s bag with his foot, dragged it across the floor and put a coat over it before leaving the restaurant. Although several Secret Service agents were accompanying Ms. Noem, they were more than 20 feet away from her at the time to give her privacy to enjoy a meal with her family. In a social media post about the arrest, Ms. Noem described the suspect as a “career criminal” and a foreign national who had entered the United States illegally. The Secret Service did not confirm Ms. Noem’s allegation but directed the questions to federal prosecutors assigned to the case. Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney in Washington, said the suspect had entered the United States illegally and that law enforcement officials were seeking more people connected to the theft. Mr. McCool, the Secret Service agent, said in a statement that five law enforcement agencies, including Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, were involved in the investigation. The theft was the latest episode that raised questions about the Secret Service, which has been under intense scrutiny since Donald J. Trump was the target of two assassination attempts last year as a presidential candidate. Minho Kim covers breaking news and climate change for The Times. He is based in Washington.

"Supporters say an annual cap of 10 percent, including inflation, will protect tenants. Critics worry it will reduce housing supply and discourage investors.",2025-04-27,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by By David W. Chen David W. Chen reported from Washington State last year to examine the growing movement for rent regulations in the West. After a protracted battle, Washington State lawmakers voted Sunday to limit annual residential rent increases to no more than 10 percent, positioning the state to become the third in the country to adopt statewide rent regulations. Among the key provisions of House Bill 1217: Annual rent increases would be capped at 7 percent plus the rate of inflation, or 10 percent in all — whichever is less. A flat annual increase of 5 percent would be applied to people who own homes in mobile home parks and rent the land on which they sit. Only lease renewals would be affected by the new measure. Landlords would be allowed to increase rents at will when properties become vacant. The rules would not apply to new buildings for the first 12 years they are occupied. Between 2001 and 2023, median residential rents in Washington State rose by 43 percent, adjusted for inflation, outpacing the 26 percent rise in renters’ incomes over the same period, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a national research group. And while there is broad consensus that more housing needs to be built, supporters of the caps say they can offer short-term predictability and protections for tenants who have been forced to move because of steep price increases. The issue has long been a priority for Democrats, and the Legislature nearly passed a similar bill in 2024. But this year, with a more turbulent economy, supporters say the problem has never been more urgent. “At a time when people worry whether they’ll lose their federal benefits, we can help assure them that here in Washington you won’t face an excessive rent hike,” said Emily Alvarado, a Democratic state senator and one of the bill’s sponsors, during a floor debate Friday night. Most economists have historically been skeptical of rent control, saying it does more harm than good. But that has started to change somewhat in recent years. In Washington, opponents say rent regulations would discourage new development and reduce the availability of rental homes. And for years, Republicans, joined by moderate Democrats, have scuttled various proposals. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

By Eduardo Medina Federal agents raided an underground nightclub in Colorado early Sunday morning and detained more than 100 people who they said were undocumented immigrants, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. The raid occurred at a club in Colorado Springs, about 70 miles south of Denver. Federal officials said there were more than 200 people inside the club at the time, including 114 who were in the country illegally. More than a dozen active-duty members of the U.S. military were detained as well, they said. Officials said agents found weapons and illicit drugs inside the nightclub, including cocaine, methamphetamine and a mixture of powdered drugs known as pink cocaine. Jonathan C. Pullen, the DEA Rocky Mountain Division special agent in charge, said in a news conference that the club had been under law enforcement surveillance for months and that “drug trafficking, prostitution and crimes of violence” had been taking place inside the club. Mr. Pullen said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement took custody of the immigrants detained at the club. He said the members of the military were “running security at the club and involved in some of these crimes.” The service members were handed over to the criminal investigation division of the U.S. Army. A spokeswoman for Fort Carson, an Army post in Colorado, said in a statement on Sunday night that “there were some Fort Carson service members present at the location during” the raid.

By Alexandra E. Petri A member of the emergency medical services in Kansas City, Mo., died on Sunday after being stabbed by a patient who was being transported to a hospital in what officials said started out as a “routine medical call.” The patient stabbed the emergency worker, Graham Hoffman, a 29-year-old firefighter paramedic, in the chest, piercing his heart, city officials said in a news release. A suspect was in custody but had not been publicly identified. A motive for the attack was not immediately known. The episode began after Kansas City police officers were dispatched to a “routine medical call” early on Sunday to check on a woman who was reported to be walking along a section of highway near North Oak Trafficway, the police said. Officers found the woman and requested help from the emergency medical services for further unspecified treatment. While en route to the hospital, the patient “produced an edged weapon” and stabbed Firefighter Hoffman, the police said. Firefighter Hoffman’s partner called a crew emergency, and additional Fire Department and Police Department personnel responded. Firefighter Hoffman was taken to North Kansas City Hospital. “Despite the heroic efforts of KCFD paramedics, the hospital medical team, Firefighter Hoffman succumbed to his injuries in the intensive care unit,” the city said. Firefighter Hoffman had been a member of the Kansas City Fire Department since 2022, according to the news release. The police are working with the Clay County prosecutor on criminal charges, the city said. “We will demand accountability be applied not just to the suspect, but also for any steps in the system that fell short,” said Quinton Lucas, the mayor of Kansas City.

"President Trump ordered a start to the strikes against the Houthis on March 15. Congressional officials say the campaign has cost well over $1 billion.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Middle East Tensions Advertisement Supported by President Trump ordered a start to the strikes against the Houthis on March 15. Congressional officials say the campaign has cost well over $1 billion. By Edward Wong Reporting from Washington American forces have hit more than 800 targets in Yemen during an ongoing air campaign that began six weeks ago against the Houthi militia, the U.S. military said on Sunday. The military said the targets of the strikes, called Operation Rough Rider, included “multiple command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities and advanced weapons storage locations.” Among the arms and equipment in stockpiles struck by the Americans were antiship ballistic and cruise missiles and drones, the types of weapons that the Houthis have used against ships in the Red Sea, the military said. The details were outlined in an announcement issued by U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations and forces in the Middle East. Congressional officials say the campaign has cost well over $1 billion so far, based on closed-door briefings Pentagon officials gave to Congress early this month, just three weeks into the campaign. The New York Times reported in early April on the rapid rate of munitions used in the campaign, a rate that has caused concern among some strategic planners in the U.S. military. The Houthis have been firing projectiles and launching drones at commercial and military ships in the Red Sea as a show of solidarity with the residents of Gaza and with Hamas, the militant group that controls it. Palestinians in Gaza have been under assault by Israel since Hamas carried out a deadly strike in southern Israel in October 2023 and took hostages. Israeli and Houthi forces have also launched attacks against each other’s countries. On March 15, President Trump ordered the U.S. military to begin a continual air campaign against the Houthis, after the Biden administration carried out some strikes. Until Sunday, the U.S. military had not publicly disclosed the number of targets struck in Operation Rough Rider. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The ferry was carrying 45 people when it was struck near a bridge in Clearwater, Fla. Ten other people were injured, the authorities said.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The ferry was carrying 45 people when it was struck near a bridge in Clearwater, Fla. Ten other people were injured, the authorities said. By Alexandra E. Petri and Neil Vigdor One person was killed and 10 other people were injured on Sunday night when a boat slammed into the back of a ferry full of passengers in Clearwater, Fla., the authorities said. The driver of the boat that hit the Clearwater Ferry, which was carrying 45 people, left the scene shortly after the crash, officials said on Monday during a news conference. Investigators said the operator of that boat was cooperating with them after they located him at a boat launch about 3.5 miles away from where the crash happened, which was near the Memorial Causeway Bridge. They said the man had volunteered to take a breath test and did not have alcohol in his system. Capt. Matthew Dallarosa of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said that investigators were still working with prosecutors to determine whether the crash was a hit-and-run and whether charges would be brought. “To the fullest extent of the law, we’ll prosecute any crime that is discovered,” Captain Dallarosa said during the news conference. The collision occurred around 8:40 p.m. local time while the 40-foot ferry was returning from Clearwater Beach, Fla., to downtown Clearwater, a 30-minute ride, emergency responders said. It was unclear what had led to the crash, which was captured in a video that drew widespread attention online. It showed the 37-foot recreational boat rear-ending the ferry and overriding about three-quarters of the ferry, officials said. “Our 911 call takers could hear what they describe as horrific screaming in the background,” Chief Eric Gandy of the Clearwater Police Department said at the news conference. Officials said the people who were injured were taken to several hospitals in the area, and received treatment for head injuries, broken bones and soft tissue damage. Officials did not provide updates on their conditions on Monday. They identified the ferry passenger who died as Jose Castro, 41, of Palm Harbor, Fla. There were six people on the boat that ran into the ferry, according to investigators, who said that both vessels had been impounded. The ferry ended up on a sandbar after the collision, officials said. Neil Vigdor covers breaking news for The Times, with a focus on politics.

"In a fiery speech in New Hampshire, the Illinois governor railed against both President Trump and what he called the “simpering timidity” among some Democrats.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by In a fiery speech in New Hampshire, the Illinois governor railed against both President Trump and what he called the “simpering timidity” among some Democrats. By Lisa Lerer and Reid J. Epstein Lisa Lerer and Reid J. Epstein have reported on Democratic Party politics since President Trump came to power the first time. Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois strode into a ballroom filled with top New Hampshire Democrats on Sunday and by the end of his nearly 30-minute speech had them ready to storm the political barricades against President Trump. “It’s time to fight everywhere and all at once,” he told the group of Democratic activists, officials and donors, who jumped to their feet with hoots and applause. “Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. But I am now. These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace.” “The reckoning is finally here,” he declared. For the Trump administration, of course, but also for his own party. In the fight over the future of the Democratic Party, Mr. Pritzker has emerged as a leader of an insurgent faction calling for a full-throated, unflinching barrage of attacks on Mr. Trump, his Republican allies and their right-wing agenda. His speech was a call to action more aggressive and comprehensive than perhaps any other by a major liberal figure since Mr. Trump took office, rivaled only by rallying cries from Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on their Western tour. But unlike them, Mr. Pritzker set his stem-winding address in a state with a century-long hold on the nation’s first presidential primary contest — a striking statement on its own. Mr. Pritzker, of course, rebuffed any suggestion that his appearance on Sunday night in Manchester, N.H., represented the opening bell of the 2028 Democratic primary race. He said he was focused on backing the party’s efforts in next year’s midterm elections. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"Republican lawmakers are set to lay out specifics of their sweeping fiscal package as Congress returns for a critical month, giving Democrats an opening for fresh attacks.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Congressional Memo Republican lawmakers are set to lay out specifics of their sweeping fiscal package as Congress returns for a critical month, giving Democrats an opening for fresh attacks. By Carl Hulse Reporting from Washington Out of power, disorganized and stung by their November election losses, Democrats have struggled to mount a coherent response to President Trump as he has unleashed a blitz of contentious nominations, explosive executive orders and an unforeseen rampage by Elon Musk and his acolytes through the executive branch. Now, with Congress returning from its spring recess on Monday and Republicans under pressure to deliver on a legislative agenda, Democrats believe they have a prime opportunity for a reset. Republicans will be forced to begin providing politically charged specifics of their tax and spending program, handing the minority ample fodder for attacks. House Republicans have so far been able to generalize about their spending plans in the budget outline that they barely squeezed through the House and Senate. But beginning this week in multiple House committees, lawmakers will have to explain in public how they would achieve $1.5 trillion or more in savings to go with hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending on the military and border enforcement, and trillions in tax cuts. “Up to this point, Republicans have been lying about their intentions,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House Democratic leader, said in an interview. “As we move forward with the next phase of the budget process, it will become crystal clear in committee after committee the damage they are trying to do to the American people.” Democrats say that no cut is too small to highlight. They intend to highlight the consequences of the G.O.P. plan, from reducing food assistance for the poor to eliminating clean energy tax credits. They plan to call special attention to possible Medicaid cuts, an issue they have raised repeatedly in recent months. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

By Robert Draper Reporting from Washington The lone Republican vote in the Senate last month to protect consumers from bank overdraft fees came from an unlikely Democratic ally: Senator Josh Hawley, the archconservative from Missouri best known for calling out “wokeness” in all sectors of society, and for raising his fist to offer solidarity with supporters of President Trump hours before the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. And yet the overdraft vote was hardly the first time Mr. Hawley had stood apart from his Republican colleagues. In 2023 he introduced a bill to cap out-of-pocket insulin costs at $25 per month, which died in committee for lack of Republican support. He has broken from his party by refusing to vote for cuts to Medicaid as part of the budget reconciliation process. In March he joined a Democrat, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, to offer a bill that would speed up the contracting process for new unions. A G.O.P. senator, Bernie Moreno of Ohio, signed on as a cosponsor, but otherwise, Mr. Hawley said in a recent phone interview, “not a single Republican would touch it.” Since his arrival to the Senate in 2019 at the age of 39 as its youngest member, Mr. Hawley has charted two seemingly parallel courses: as a full-throttle champion of socially conservative causes and, somewhat less noisily, as a populist who aligns himself with Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, on many populist issues. “His ultimate goal is to break the alliance the social conservatives have had with the corporate world since the Reagan era,” said Matt Stoller, a former Senate aide to Mr. Sanders. The term “populist” conjures two raw-knuckled protagonists of the agrarian South, Andrew Jackson and Huey Long, with whom the whippetlike Mr. Hawley, a Missouri banker’s son who attended Stanford and Yale Law School, would seem to have little in common. But prioritizing working-class Americans over elites has been a key rhetorical theme in Mr. Trump’s political ascendancy, and Mr. Hawley has embraced it.

Kneedler, a government lawyer with a reputation for candor, care and integrity. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington After a routine Supreme Court argument on April 23, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked the lawyer who had represented the government to return to the lectern. “You have just presented your 160th argument before this court, and I understand it is intended to be your last,” the chief justice told the lawyer, Edwin S. Kneedler, who is retiring as a deputy solicitor general. “That is the record for modern times.” Chief Justice Roberts talked a little more, with affection and high praise, thanking Mr. Kneedler for his “extraordinary care and professionalism.” Then something remarkable happened. Applause burst out in the courtroom, and that led to a standing ovation for Mr. Kneedler, with the justices joining, too. “It was a rare moment of unanimity and spontaneous joy from all nine justices on the bench,” said Richard Lazarus, a law professor at Harvard. “They were all beaming.” Kannon Shanmugam, a veteran Supreme Court lawyer, said it was “one of the most electric moments I’ve ever seen in the courtroom.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

But in the deeply blue city, the plan to deploy them has drawn uneasy comparisons to the talk of President Trump.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by New Mexico’s governor said the troops are needed to help quell violence. But in the deeply blue city, the plan to deploy them has drawn uneasy comparisons to the talk of President Trump. By Jack Healy Reporting from Albuquerque To critics, President Trump’s threat to deploy the military to fight crime and unrest in America’s cities is a nightmare scenario, a pretext for martial law and a potential assault on democracy. But starting next month, dozens of National Guard troops will be on the streets of a deeply Democratic city, Albuquerque, in a deeply Democratic state, New Mexico. And they are being deployed by the state’s governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat. She said they are needed to help the strained police force confront a crisis of violent crime and fentanyl use. “The situation in Albuquerque has reached an unacceptable crisis point,” she said. “We simply cannot wait for traditional solutions to take effect.” Few residents of Albuquerque would deny the scourge of violence in a neighborhood bisected by Route 66 and home to dense blocks of auto shops, immigrant-run businesses and working-class families. Officially, it is the International District. But many call it the War Zone. The governor’s move to deploy Guard troops more commonly seen at wildfires, hurricanes and tornadoes has divided locals, reflecting the broader civil war within the Democratic Party over crime and disorder. It is already emerging as an issue among the Democrats who seek to succeed her in the governor’s office in Santa Fe. Some praised the Guard’s arrival, saying extra resources could help to restore order before the 100-year anniversary of Route 66 brings thousands of tourists to Albuquerque next year. Critics called it an invasion of a neglected neighborhood that desperately needs better housing and services. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"President Trump said in a post on social media that he was “reinstating Columbus Day.” It was never canceled as a federal holiday.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by President Trump said in a post on social media that he was “reinstating Columbus Day.” It was never canceled as a federal holiday. By Ali Watkins President Trump declared on Sunday that he would bring “Columbus Day back from the ashes” and reinstate its celebration as a holiday. “I am hereby reinstating Columbus Day under the same rules, dates, and locations, as it has had for all of the many decades before!” the president said in a post on Truth Social, referring to the federal holiday named for Christopher Columbus, the Italian explorer who sailed to the Americas on behalf of Spain more than 500 years ago. The holiday has long been criticized by those who condemn the explorer for paving the way for European colonialism, which brought catastrophic diseases and led to the decimation of Indigenous populations in America. But Columbus Day was never canceled as a federal holiday. The second Monday in October is still widely referred to as such in the United States, and for many, it remains an important part of Italian American heritage. With his declaration, Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to a proclamation issued by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2021. That decree also recognized the day as Indigenous Peoples’ Day, which recognizes the Indigenous communities that have lived in the Americas for thousands of years, and called for it to be celebrated alongside Columbus Day. “The Democrats did everything possible to destroy Christopher Columbus, his reputation, and all of the Italians that love him so much,” Mr. Trump claimed in his social media post on Sunday. In 2021, Mr. Biden became the first U.S. president to formally recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day, vowing to “honor America’s first inhabitants and the Tribal Nations that continue to thrive today.” But Mr. Biden did not rename the longstanding holiday, which is still officially known as Columbus Day. While several states and dozens of cities recognize it as Indigenous Peoples’ Day, it is not considered a federal holiday, though there have been occasional efforts in Congress to make it one. Mr. Biden’s 2021 declaration came amid heightened public debate about the erasure of Indigenous people in celebrations of Christopher Columbus, whose landing in North America led to centuries of exploitation and slaughter of Native American populations. At the time, dozens of Christopher Columbus statues were taken down, many in the midst of the Black Lives Matter protests that followed the death of George Floyd in May 2020.

"A transcript of one of the last things he wrote before he died.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Pope Succession Advertisement Supported by A transcript of one of the last things he wrote before he died. By Pope Francis Pope Francis was head of the Catholic Church until his death on April 21. This is the full text of a foreword written by Pope Francis to a book outlining Catholic teachings on love and marriage for young people. It was translated from Italian by Isabella Corletto. Read more about the letter here. Dear friends, In my homeland of Argentina, there is a dance I love very much, one that I often participated in when I was young: the tango. Tango is a wonderful, free game between man and woman, filled with erotic charm and attraction. The male and female dancers court each other and experience closeness and distance, sensuality, attention, discipline and dignity. They rejoice in love and understand what it might mean to give themselves to someone completely. Perhaps it is due to my distant memory of this dance that I have called my great apostolic exhortation on marriage “Amoris Laetitia”: the joy of love. I am always touched to see young people who love each other and have the courage to transform their love into something great: “I want to love you until death do us part.” What an extraordinary promise! Of course, I am not blind, and neither are you. How many marriages today fail after three, five, seven years? Maybe your parents, too, began the sacrament of marriage with that same courage, but were unable to take their love to completion. Wouldn’t it be better, then, to avoid the pain, to touch each other only as though in a passing dance, to enjoy each other, play together, and then leave? Do not believe this! Believe in love, believe in God, and believe that you are capable of taking on the adventure of a love that lasts a lifetime. Love wants to be permanent; “until further notice” isn’t love. We humans have the desire to be accepted without reservations, and those who do not have this experience often — unknowingly — carry a wound for the rest of their lives. Instead, those who enter into a union lose nothing, but gain everything: life at its fullest. Holy Scripture is very clear: “That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh” (Genesis 2:24). One flesh! Jesus takes this all to its culmination: “So they are no longer two, but one flesh” (Mark 10:8). One single body. One single home. One single life. One single family. One single love. In order to help you build a foundation for your relationship based on God’s faithful love, I have called upon the whole Church to do much more for you. We cannot continue on as before: many only see the beautiful ritual. And then, after some years, they separate. Faith is destroyed. Wounds are opened. There are often children who are missing a father or a mother. To me, this is like dancing tango poorly. Tango is a dance that must be learned. This is all the more true when it comes to marriage and family. Before receiving the sacrament of marriage, a proper preparation is necessary. A catechumenate, I would even venture to say, because all life takes place in love, and love is not something to take lightly. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"In a foreword to a book, he articulated the church’s position on marriage.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Pope Succession Advertisement Supported by In a foreword to a book, he articulated the church’s position on marriage. By Lauren Jackson Lauren Jackson spent the past year reporting on Americans’ religious beliefs. In the days since his death, Pope Francis has been called a reformer, outsider, influencer and modernizer. He was all of these things. But he was also the steward of the oldest institution in the Western world. He protected the Roman Catholic Church’s doctrine — even if he did so in his own style. That is evident in one of Francis’ last writings, which was provided to The New York Times and has not previously been published. It’s a short foreword to a book, written for young Catholics, about the church’s teachings on love and marriage. The book is from the YOUCAT Foundation (short for youth catechism, or doctrine), an organization approved by the Vatican to publish the church’s teachings in a way that young people can understand. The foundation distributes books in 70 languages around the world. In the foreword, Francis articulates the church’s position on marriage: that it is a priority, one of sacred importance, and is only between a man and a woman. He breaks no new doctrinal ground. Still, the letter illustrates who Francis was as a pope: a pragmatic and compassionate communicator who skillfully repackaged, without necessarily changing, the church’s doctrine for a modern era. (Read the full text here.) “It’s a confirmation of a legacy,” Raúl Zegarra, a professor of Catholicism at Harvard, said. “It’s really a classic text by the pope.” In his opening lines, Francis captures much of his approach to the papacy. “In my homeland of Argentina, there is a dance I love very much, one that I often participated in when I was young: the tango,” Francis, the first Latin American pope, writes. He then compares the tango, in all of its “discipline and dignity,” to marriage. “I am always touched to see young people who love each other and have the courage to transform their love into something great: ‘I want to love you until death do us part.’ What an extraordinary promise!” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"An analysis by The New York Times found that schools targeted by the Trump administration have sharply increased spending on lobbying and became far more reliant on lobbyists with Republican ties.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by An analysis by The New York Times found that schools targeted by the Trump administration have sharply increased spending on lobbying and became far more reliant on lobbyists with Republican ties. By Steven Rich and Vimal Patel Top colleges in the cross hairs of President Trump have sharply increased their spending on lobbying, according to an analysis by The New York Times. Ten universities that have been singled out by the administration for scrutiny spent a combined $2.8 million lobbying the federal government in the first three months of 2025, which is more than those institutions spent in any quarter at least since 2008, according to the analysis. A federal task force that says it is devoted to rooting out antisemitism on campuses targeted those schools in February for investigation. One of the 10, Columbia University, more than tripled its spending on lobbying in the first quarter of 2025, compared with the same quarter last year, the analysis found. Another, Harvard University, also greatly increased its lobbying outlays, spending $230,000, compared with $130,000 in the same period last year. Lobbyists generally seek meetings with White House and Congressional staff members to discuss matters that affect the institutions they represent. Public records show that for the targeted schools, those matters in the first months of 2025 included, among other things, seeking financial aid for students, promoting the value of university research and explaining efforts to combat antisemitism. Colleges that have been accused by the Trump administration of being bastions of leftism are seeking the help of firms that are in tune with conservative sensibilities. Much of the new spending on lobbying is flowing to firms with Republican bona fides. The amount the schools spent on contracted lobbying firms increased nearly 150 percent from the first quarter of 2024 to this year. The analysis found that these schools were far more reliant on lobbyists with Republican ties than a year before. The universities singled out by the administration spent more on lobbying in the first quarter of 2025 than in any other quarter in more than a decade. Note: Includes figures for the entire University of California system. Only two of its 10 campuses are on the Trump administration’s list.

"The announcement comes as the Trump administration pressures firms to expand their U.S. manufacturing.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The announcement comes as the Trump administration pressures firms to expand their U.S. manufacturing. By Danielle Kaye IBM on Monday joined a slew of technology companies to announce plans for new investments in the United States, as the Trump administration pressures firms to expand their U.S. manufacturing. The software company, headquartered in Armonk, N.Y., said it would invest $150 billion in the United States over the next five years, including $30 billion to support production of its mainframe and quantum computers. The announcement, framed in part as an effort to fuel the American economy, comes after the chipmaker Nvidia said this month it would invest $500 billion and produce all of its A.I. supercomputers in the United States. “With this investment and manufacturing commitment, we are ensuring that IBM remains the epicenter of the world’s most advanced computing and AI capabilities,” Arvind Krishna, IBM’s chief executive, said in a statement. But whether pledges from IBM and other tech giants fully come to fruition remains to be seen. Investments touted by major firms, including during President Trump’s first term, have at times fallen short of plans described in their announcements. A $10 billion project announced in Wisconsin by the electronics manufacturer Foxconn in 2018 — hailed by Mr. Trump as the “eighth wonder of the world” — fell far short of expectations. The announcements have come steadily since Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s largest chip manufacturer, said last month it would spend $100 billion in the United States over the next four years to expand its production capacity and bring its most advanced semiconductor processes to its operations in Arizona. In February, days after Apple’s chief executive met with Mr. Trump, the company said that it planned to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the United States over the next four years, and open a factory in Texas to make the machines that power the company’s push into artificial intelligence. In January, Mr. Trump announced a joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle to create at least $100 billion in computing infrastructure to power artificial intelligence, an initiative that added to tech companies’ significant investments in U.S. data centers, although the push to form the venture predated his term. The Trump administration has pressured companies to produce more in the United States, with a particular aim at China. Even so, it has spared smartphones, computers, semiconductors and other electronics from tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on Chinese goods as part of his trade war.

He will also give up his leadership spot on the oversight panel as he faces cancer. By Michael Gold Reporting from Washington Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia, an eight-term Democrat, announced on Monday that he would not seek re-election and would soon relinquish his position as the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, as he faces cancer. Mr. Connolly, 75, announced late last year that he was being treated for cancer of the esophagus but planned to fight the disease while continuing to do his job in Washington, saying he was “very confident of a successful outcome.” In a letter to his constituents on Monday, he said that the disease, “while initially beaten back, has now returned,” prompting his decision to step aside and ultimately retire. Mr. Connolly said he planned to do “everything possible” to finish out what he said would be his final term. “I will be stepping back as ranking member of the Oversight Committee soon,” he wrote. “With no rancor and a full heart, I move into this final chapter full of pride in what we’ve accomplished together over 30 years.” Mr. Connolly’s announcement did not make clear when he may hand over his position, and a spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is scheduled to hold a crucial hearing on Wednesday about its portion of Republicans’ tax and spending program, which includes changes to federal employees’ benefits and gives them the option to give up civil service protections to make more money.

"The lawsuit seeks to prevent the Trump administration from carrying out operations that disrupt certain civic spaces, particularly those where adults and children congregate together.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The lawsuit seeks to prevent the Trump administration from carrying out operations that disrupt certain civic spaces, particularly those where adults and children congregate together. By Zach Montague Reporting from Washington A lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s policy of allowing immigration enforcement agents to act in spaces like schools and houses of worship was filed in Oregon on Monday, seeking to settle a legal debate over whether those areas should be off-limits. The suit, brought by Justice Action Center and Innovation Law Lab, follows efforts by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to step up deportations, which have so far fallen short of President Trump’s goals. Immigration agents, aided by state and local law enforcement, carried out mass arrests over the weekend that ensnared nearly 800 people in Florida. A growing number of children, including some who were citizens as young as 2, have been removed. It was unclear where the hundreds in Florida were arrested over the four-day operation, though such efforts in communities require substantial planning. The lawsuit asks a federal judge to restore a policy set during the Biden administration that generally prohibits immigration agents from carrying out operations that disrupt civic spaces, particularly ones where adults and children congregate together. The suit also asks the court to nullify a memo from Mr. Trump’s first week in office overturning that policy, arguing that it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of assembly. The case brings together a diverse coalition of labor organizations, interfaith groups and parishes, with member organizations and constituents in all 50 states. Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center, said it was bipartisan consensus for decades to avoid conducting deportation and detention operations in places like food banks, vaccination clinics or testing sites, funerals, day cares or disaster relief shelters.

"The president directed his administration to compile a list of “sanctuary cities” that do not cooperate with federal enforcement of immigration laws.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The president directed his administration to compile a list of “sanctuary cities” that do not cooperate with federal enforcement of immigration laws. By Luke Broadwater and Zolan Kanno-Youngs Reporting from Washington President Trump signed three more executive orders on Monday, including one targeting local jurisdictions that the administration says are not cooperating with its aggressive immigration crackdown. One order directs Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, to publish a list of state and local jurisdictions that the Trump administration considers “sanctuary cities,” meaning they limit or refuse to cooperate with federal officials’ efforts to arrest undocumented immigrants. It calls for pursuing “all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures” against jurisdictions that continue to oppose the administration’s immigration crackdown. A second order instructs the Trump administration to provide legal resources to police officers accused of wrongdoing; review and attempt to modify existing restraints on law enforcement, such as federal consent decrees; provide military equipment to local law enforcement; and use enforcement measures against local officials who “unlawfully prohibiting law enforcement officers from carrying out duties.” Earlier in the day, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said the order would “unleash America’s law enforcement to pursue criminals.” A third executive order seeks to enforce existing rules requiring professional truck drivers to be proficient in English. The order requires the Transportation Department to place any driver who cannot speak and read English “out of service.” “Proficiency in English,” Mr. Trump’s order states, “should be a non-negotiable safety requirement for professional drivers.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Hundreds of lawyers and other staff members are fleeing the arm of the agency that defends constitutional rights, which appointees intend to reshape to enact President Trump’s agenda.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Campus Crackdown Advertisement Supported by Hundreds of lawyers and other staff members are fleeing the arm of the agency that defends constitutional rights, which appointees intend to reshape to enact President Trump’s agenda. By Devlin Barrett Reporting from Washington Hundreds of lawyers and other staff members are leaving the Justice Department’s civil rights division, as veterans of the office say they have been driven out by Trump administration officials who want to drop its traditional work in order to aggressively pursue cases against the Ivy League, other schools and liberal cities. The wave of departures has only accelerated in recent days, as the administration reopened its “deferred resignation program,” which would allow employees to resign but continue to be paid for a period of time. The offer, for those who work in the division, expires on Monday. More than 100 lawyers are expected to take it, on top of a raft of earlier departures, in what would amount to a decimation of the ranks of a crucial part of the Justice Department. “Now, over 100 attorneys decided that they’d rather not do what their job requires them to do, and I think that’s fine,” Harmeet K. Dhillon, the new head of the division, said in an interview with the conservative commentator Glenn Beck over the weekend, welcoming the turnover and making plain the division’s priorities. “We don’t want people in the federal government who feel like it’s their pet project to go persecute” police departments, she said. “The job here is to enforce the federal civil rights laws, not woke ideology.” Traditionally the department has protected the constitutional rights of minority communities and marginalized people, often by monitoring police departments for civil rights violations, protecting the right to vote and fighting housing discrimination. Now, more than a dozen current and former civil rights division lawyers say, the new administration appears intent on not simply modifying the direction of the work, as has been typical during changeovers from a Democratic administration to a Republican one.

When he was a 29-year-old on the Austin City Council, Greg Casar led a charge to repeal a ban on camping in the city so that homeless people would not rack up criminal records that could make it harder to find permanent housing. Tent cities sprang up, conservatives protested and residents voted to reinstate the ban. These days, Mr. Casar, 35, is the chairman of the House Progressive Caucus and a rising star in a Democratic Party struggling to find its footing during the second coming of President Trump. He has shifted his emphasis to respond. “We can’t be known as the party of just the most vulnerable people,” Mr. Casar, the bilingual son of Mexican immigrants, said in a recent interview in an Uber en route to a town hall in Thornton, Colo. “This isn’t just about lifting up the poorest people, and that’s where the progressive movement has been.” Mr. Casar’s goal now is winning back the working people who feel as though the Democratic Party is not for them anymore. He said that also means making economic matters, rather than cultural or identity issues, the party’s bread and butter. “I’m shifting and changing,” he said. “On immigration, for example, in 2017, I would say, ‘Immigrant rights are human rights.’ I still believe that, but I’m now saying, ‘We need to make sure that all workers have equal rights.’” He and his team refer to it as Resistance 2.0, and Mr. Casar took it out for a test drive last week. On a school stage here in this city north of Denver, more than 900 miles away from his district, he stood beside a cardboard cutout of a Republican lawmaker whose feet had been replaced with chicken claws.

"The case is being watched closely by disability rights groups, which warned that arguments by a school district could threaten broader protections for disabled people.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Religious Charter School Challenge Advertisement Supported by The case is being watched closely by disability rights groups, which warned that arguments by a school district could threaten broader protections for disabled people. By Abbie VanSickle Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court appeared skeptical on Monday of a Minnesota school district’s argument that students with disabilities must prove their school acted in “bad faith” in failing to provide adequate accommodations in order to prove discrimination. A family who had sued the district, the Osseo Area School District near Minneapolis, argued that federal law required merely that the school display “deliberate indifference,” a lower standard. The two sides had argued in front of lower courts over the legal standard in schools. But in recent court filings, the school district argued that the higher standard could apply broadly to all sorts of disability rights claims under the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. That unnerved some disability rights groups, who warned that if the court accepted the school district’s argument, the higher “bad faith” standard could make it much harder for Americans with disabilities to successfully bring court challenges. The school district’s position led to an unusually tense oral argument, with lawyers for the family and the federal government arguing that the district had improperly shifted its position after the justices had agreed to hear the case. The lawyer for the school district rejected those claims, going so far as to suggest that her opponents were lying, an accusation that prompted a rebuke from one of the justices. The case, A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schools, No. 24-249, stemmed from a dispute over whether the Minnesota school district provided reasonable accommodations for Ava Tharpe, a teenage girl with severe epilepsy that made it difficult for her to attend school during normal hours.

"As part of legislation to pay for President Trump’s domestic agenda, including his immigration crackdown, House Republicans want to impose or increase fees for legal entry into the United States.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by As part of legislation to pay for President Trump’s domestic agenda, including his immigration crackdown, House Republicans want to impose or increase fees for legal entry into the United States. By Michael Gold Reporting from the Capitol  House Republicans are proposing to charge migrants $1,000 to claim asylum, one of a series of new or increased fees on immigrants seeking to gain legal entry into the United States that is part of their effort to curb immigration and pay for the Trump administration’s border crackdown. The fees on immigrants are one of several proposals in legislation released on Monday by the House Judiciary Committee to be included in the major domestic policy bill Republicans are putting together to implement President Trump’s domestic agenda. The application fee would be the first time the United States specifically charged migrants who are seeking asylum, a status meant for people who have been persecuted or fear they will be persecuted in their home country because of their race, religion or nationality. Typically, migrants who claim asylum are released into the United States to wait for court appearances. But a huge backlog in such claims has kept many of those seeking asylum in the country for years, waiting for their cases to be heard. Under the bill, applicants would also pay $100 a year while their application is pending, The bill would also require a $1,000 fee for most immigrants who are paroled into the United States and a $3,500 fee for those sponsoring children — large sums that could make it more difficult for minors who cross the border alone to be released from federal custody and taken in by family members in the United States. Asylum seekers and people under temporary protected status — meant to protect them from being sent back to countries facing conflict or natural disasters — would have to pay a $550 fee when applying for authorization to work. Those fees, likely to be burdensome to many immigrants, would serve as a further deterrent to those considering crossing the border illegally. Such crossings are currently at their lowest level in years. Though the Republicans’ budget blueprint generally calls for slashing taxes and government spending, it provides for increased funding for immigration enforcement, deportations and border security initiatives. The plan being considered by the House Judiciary Committee calls for $45 billion to build and expand immigrant detention centers, $8 billion to hire Immigration and Customs Enforcement staff and $1.25 billion to help the Justice Department immigration judges, their staff and their courts. Portions of many of the new or expanded fees for migrants would be directed toward supporting the new spending. The judiciary panel is set to consider the proposal this week, and several other House committees are also scheduled to meet to lay out their portions of the domestic policy package. Democrats have said they expect those sessions to provide substantial fodder for attacks against Republicans, given that the G.O.P. budget would require major cuts to popular federal programs including Medicaid.

"Officials in the Upper Midwest warned of possible power outages and closed some schools early as the storms loomed.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Officials in the Upper Midwest warned of possible power outages and closed some schools early as the storms loomed. By Jay SenterAnn Hinga Klein and Julie Bosman Jay Senter reported from St. Paul, Minn., Ann Hinga Klein from Des Moines, and Julie Bosman from Chicago. Schools shuttered early and cities warned of probable power outages, as potentially dangerous thunderstorms threatened the Upper Midwest late Monday afternoon. In northeast Iowa, southeast Minnesota and western Wisconsin, residents were bracing for storms that could bring high winds, tornadoes and hail the size of Ping-Pong balls. The Upper Midwest is accustomed to severe weather, but the high level of risk for very large hail and strong tornadoes caused alarm for state and local officials, who activated emergency operations centers and closed nonemergency city buildings. “We always have severe weather, I guess, in Iowa,” said Superintendent Joe Carter of the Algona Community School District, about two hours north of Des Moines. “I think the difference with this one is the threat of really, really strong stuff, such as tornadoes, and with a Category 4 ranking of severity.” Some Moderate High A large area that includes Minneapolis and St. Paul is under a relatively high risk (Level 4 out of 5) for severe weather, according to the National Weather Service’s Storm Prediction Center. At least five school districts across north central Iowa announced early closings on Monday afternoon. The Algona Community School District let out classes at 2 p.m. and canceled afterschool track and golf meets so that buses could get students home throughout the 400-square-mile district before storms descended by early evening.

"The head of a Peace Corps alumni group said he was told the cuts would affect full-time employees, not the volunteers working overseas.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The head of a Peace Corps alumni group said he was told the cuts would affect full-time employees, not the volunteers working overseas. By David A. Fahrenthold David A. Fahrenthold is an investigative reporter who writes primarily about nonprofit organizations. The head of a Peace Corps alumni group said on Monday he had been informed that the agency was planning to reduce the number of full-time staff who support volunteers overseas. The official, Dan Baker, president and chief executive of the National Peace Corps Association, said he had heard the news the same day from Cheryl Faye, who is the Peace Corps’ acting deputy chief executive. He said he was told that the cuts were planned at the behest of Elon Musk’s cost-cutting team, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which has dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development and other foreign-aid agencies. The Peace Corps confirmed in a statement that the Musk team was assessing its operations and “working to identify additional efficiencies in our staffing structure.” “The agency will remain operational and continue to recruit, place, and train volunteers, while continuing to support their health, safety and security, and effective service,” the Peace Corps said. Mr. Baker said he had been told that the Peace Corps would not close any offices in foreign countries or reduce the numbers of volunteers it takes per year. The agency, which operates independently within the executive branch, was founded under President John F. Kennedy. It has about 3,000 volunteers who serve for two years in one of 60 developing countries. “The Peace Corps has received guidance that they’re not going to cut volunteers and countries, but the staffing impact is going to be significantly stressful for their operations,” Mr. Baker said, recounting the conversation. The Peace Corps has about 970 full-time American employees who recruit new volunteers and oversee their training, health care and security. Of those employees, about 790 work in the United States. Mr. Baker said he was not told how many of those jobs the Peace Corps intended to cut. To begin the reductions, Mr. Baker said, the agency on Monday offered employees a chance to take “early retirement,” to be paid through the end of this year. The agency confirmed in its statement that staff members had until May 6 to apply for the administration’s “deferred resignation” offer. David A.

"Mark Kelly of Arizona, a Democrat and former astronaut who previously consulted for SpaceX, discusses Elon Musk, DOGE and President Trump.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Newsletter Mark Kelly of Arizona, a Democrat and former astronaut who previously consulted for SpaceX, discusses Elon Musk, DOGE and President Trump. By Jess Bidgood Senator Mark Kelly knows Elon Musk better than most Americans do. Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, is a former NASA astronaut and Navy combat pilot. He used to consult for SpaceX about crew safety, he told me, and sat in on meetings there with Musk. He drove a Tesla for a while, before very publicly returning it this year. In a way, Kelly embodies the whiplash many Democrats feel when it comes to Musk, and he has emerged as one of the billionaire’s most vocal critics in Washington. With the Trump administration approaching its 100th day tomorrow, I called Kelly to ask him what it’s like to tangle with Musk on X — and what power Democrats really have to unwind the changes Musk has already set into motion. JB: You are one of many Democrats who have decided to return their Teslas. Do you miss it? MK: No, no. There’s things I liked about it, which was the performance. The thing is pretty incredible from an acceleration standpoint. It’s the closest thing I can think of to a catapult-shot off the front of the aircraft carrier. Though I was back on the U.S.S. Lincoln about a year ago, in the back of an F-18, and I realized it still is not that close. It’s fun to drive. What I didn’t like about it is, I was driving less than 200 miles a month, but I was having to charge it every week, constantly thinking, OK, when am I going to plug this car in next time? Did you replace it with something? Yeah, I got a Tahoe. Elon Musk became central to certain aspects of Democrats’ messaging over the past several months. But for you, it’s been a little more personal, because Musk insulted you during an X dispute involving your brother, the astronaut Scott Kelly, about the astronauts at the Space Station — and then he called you a “traitor” after you visited Ukraine. He called me a traitor for doing my job, essentially, and supporting our ally. It’s almost comical, because if I’m the traitor, well, that means you must be on the side of Russia.

"Christopher Schurr, a former Grand Rapids police officer, is charged with second-degree murder. His lawyers say he acted in self-defense.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Christopher Schurr, a former Grand Rapids police officer, is charged with second-degree murder. His lawyers say he acted in self-defense. By Ernesto Londoño A jury in Grand Rapids, Mich., began hearing testimony on Monday in the murder trial of a white former police officer who fatally shot a Black man as the two scuffled on the ground after a traffic stop in 2022. There is no dispute about the basic sequence of events that began as the officer, Christopher Schurr, pulled over a Nissan Altima for an improper license plate in a residential area on a cold, rainy morning. After the driver, Patrick Lyoya, got out of the vehicle, he and Mr. Schurr got into a physical confrontation and tussled on the ground over control of the officer’s stun gun. In a video filmed by a bystander, Mr. Schurr could be seen struggling to pin down Mr. Lyoya before the officer reached for his firearm and shot him at close range. Jurors must decide whether Mr. Schurr’s use of deadly force amounts to second-degree murder. In opening statements on Monday, Chris Becker, the Kent County prosecutor, told jurors that the shooting “was not justified” because the Taser that the two men were grappling over did not pose a dire threat to the officer. While Mr. Lyoya resisted being arrested, Mr. Becker said there was no evidence that he intended to seriously harm Mr. Schurr. But Mikayla S. Hamilton, one of Mr. Schurr’s lawyers, said he opened fire after losing control of the Taser, which made him fear that he was “in a fight for his life.” She added: “This was not murder, this was survival, this was self-defense.” Mr. Lyoya’s fatal shooting on April 4, 2022, took place amid national debate over police misconduct and racism set off by the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Mr. Lyoya’s death led to protests in Grand Rapids, a city of about 200,000 where nearly 18 percent of residents are Black and where the case strained longstanding tensions over race and the police.

"The Take It Down Act, which united a coalition of conservative and liberal lawmakers, criminalizes the nonconsensual sharing of sexually explicit images of others and requires companies to remove them.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Take It Down Act, which united a coalition of conservative and liberal lawmakers, criminalizes the nonconsensual sharing of sexually explicit images of others and requires companies to remove them. By Michael Gold and Cecilia Kang Reporting from Washington The House on Monday overwhelmingly passed bipartisan legislation to criminalize the nonconsensual sharing of sexually explicit photos and videos of others — including A.I.-generated images known as “deepfakes” — and to mandate that platforms quickly remove them. The vote of 409 to 2 cleared the measure for President Trump, who was expected to quickly sign it. The legislation, known as the Take It Down Act, aims to crack down on the sharing of material known as “revenge porn,” requiring that social media companies and online platforms remove such images within two days of being notified of them. The measure, which brought together an unlikely coalition of conservatives and liberals in both parties, passed the Senate unanimously in February. The support of Mr. Trump, who mentioned it during his joint address to Congress last month, appears to have smoothed its path through Congress. The legislation, introduced by Senators Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, is the first internet content law to clear Congress since 2018, when lawmakers approved legislation to fight online sex trafficking. And though it focuses on revenge porn and deepfakes, the bill is seen as an important step toward regulating internet companies that have for decades escaped government scrutiny. Ms. Klobuchar said she brought the bill to the attention of Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, while speaking with them at an inauguration-day lunch. The senator said she was moved by the stories of families whose children had experienced harassment, bullying or mental and emotional harm because of these images.

"After a mixed verdict in federal court, Tennessee prosecutors began presenting their case against three former Memphis officers charged with second-degree murder.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by After a mixed verdict in federal court, Tennessee prosecutors began presenting their case against three former Memphis officers charged with second-degree murder. By Emily Cochrane and Ben Stanley Reporting from a Memphis courtroom. State prosecutors took their own case to trial on Monday against three former Memphis Police Department officers who fatally beat Tyre Nichols, aiming to secure a murder conviction after jurors in a separate federal case delivered a mixed verdict last fall. In many ways, the state trial will resemble the one that played out in federal court: It will focus heavily on surveillance and body camera footage that captured the officers beating Mr. Nichols after he tried to flee a traffic stop on foot in January 2023. The trial will also consider whether the three defendants acted in accordance with their police training. But on the first day of proceedings in a stuffy Memphis courtroom, there were some notable differences, including testimony from Mr. Nichols’s mother, RowVaughn Wells. “My son was beaten to a pulp,” Ms. Wells said, her voice shaking with emotion as she described his injuries at the hands of the officers. “There is no way my son would have survived from that,” she added. The three men on trial Monday — Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith — already face the possibility of years in prison after they were convicted on federal witness tampering charges in October. Mr. Haley was also found guilty of violating Mr. Nichols’s civil rights by causing bodily injury, though all three men were acquitted of the most serious charge, violating civil rights by causing death.

Several others were injured.",2025-04-28,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The victims’ ages ranged from 7 to 18, the police said. Several others were injured. By Alexandra E. Petri Four people, all of them children or teenagers, were killed, and several others were injured on Monday when a car crashed through an after-school center in Chatham, Ill., a village just south of Springfield, the State Police said. The car struck three of the victims outside the building and the fourth inside around 3:20 p.m., the police said. Several others were taken to the hospital, and at least one person was airlifted, the authorities said. The victims were two 7-year-olds, an 8-year-old, and an 18-year-old, the Illinois State Police said Tuesday morning. Their names were not released. Six other children were taken to hospitals, with one in critical condition, the police said. The driver, whom the authorities have not publicly identified, was not injured and was undergoing an evaluation at the hospital Monday evening, the State Police said. No one else was in the vehicle, the police said. Toxicology reports are pending, the police said. “The cause of the crash remains under investigation, but this does not appear to be a targeted attack,” they said in a statement. Officers with the Chatham Police Department, Chatham Fire Department and other agencies responded to a call Monday afternoon of a vehicle being driven into a Y.N.O.T. After School Camp, the State Police said. According to the police, the driver hit the east side of the building, striking people outside, and then continued driving through the building, hitting people inside before exiting on the west side. “A terrible tragedy has occurred here that has affected all of us,” the Chatham Police Department said in a statement. Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois expressed his condolences for the victims and their families in a statement on Monday evening and said that his administration was monitoring the situation. “Our community lost a group of bright and innocent young people with their whole lives ahead of them,” Mr. Pritzker said. “Parents said goodbye to their kids this morning not knowing it would be the last time. My heart is heavy for these families and the unimaginable grief they’re experiencing.” U.S. representatives from Illinois also express their sympathies on social media. Representative Mary Miller, a Republican, said. “My heart is with the entire community.” Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat, said, “As a dad, my heart breaks for these parents living all of our worst nightmare tonight.” Chatham, a village of around 14,500 people, is about 12 miles south of downtown Springfield, Illinois’s capital. Y.N.O.T., or Youth Needing Other Things, is an organization founded in 2002 “as a way for parents to place their kids into a safe, fun, active and stimulating summer environment,” according to its website. The group organizes summer camps and an after-school program for children. Neil Vigdor , Julie Bosman and Victor Mather contributed reporting.

The dispute has constitutional stakes.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Lawyers say the families wanted the children to remain in the United States. The Trump administration says the mothers requested the children’s removal. The dispute has constitutional stakes. By Hamed Aleaziz Reporting from Washington The removal of three children with U.S. citizenship with their families to Honduras last week has prompted alarm that President Trump’s strict immigration enforcement may have crossed “illegal and unconstitutional” lines, as a federal judge in one of the cases put it. Lawyers for the two families involved said the mothers were not given an option to leave their children in the United States before they were deported. But Mr. Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, said the mothers requested the children’s removal. The cases have added to growing concerns that the Trump administration may be violating the Constitution in its increasingly stringent crackdown on immigration, including removing U.S. citizens, a desire that Mr. Trump has expressed in the past but that legal experts say runs against longstanding prohibitions. Here is a look at the cases and what is at stake. Three children who are U.S. citizens were removed to Honduras last week as part of the deportation of other members of their families. Two of the children, ages 4 and 7, belong to one Honduran family. The mother of those children had an outstanding deportation order and had shown up to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in on Thursday, said Gracie Willis, the raids response coordinator with the National Immigration Project, who is helping the family’s immigration lawyer with the case. The 4-year-old, Ms. Willis said, has cancer. The mother had shown up to the check-in with a lawyer but was quickly thrust into the deportation process. Her lawyer had no meaningful chance to try to stop the deportation in court, Ms. Willis said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"State and city officials in California are vowing to uphold protections for immigrants, even as President Trump threatens more action against their jurisdictions.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by State and city officials in California are vowing to uphold protections for immigrants, even as President Trump threatens more action against their jurisdictions. By Soumya Karlamangla and Jesus Jiménez In 1971, Berkeley, Calif., became the first place in the nation to deem itself a sanctuary city, at the time to provide refuge for sailors who protested the Vietnam War. Today, at least 25 cities and counties in California have declared themselves sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants by passing laws that limit how much they will cooperate with federal efforts to deport people. Those policies could soon make California a greater target for the Trump administration as federal officials try to punish governments with sanctuary policies. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Monday night directing federal officials to publish a list of all jurisdictions that have declared themselves sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants in the United States. It is unclear how Mr. Trump intends to use the list, but it is possible that he may try to cut funding or take legal action against the governments that are identified. California has long been home to more undocumented immigrants than any other state and currently has about 1.8 million undocumented residents, according to the Pew Research Center. Amid threats of mass deportations during Mr. Trump’s first term, California declared itself a sanctuary state in 2017. Here is how local policies in California are playing out during the second Trump administration: Oakland, Sacramento and San Diego are among the California cities that have declared themselves “sanctuaries” for undocumented immigrants.

"A joint agreement appeared to avert a threat by President Trump of tariffs and sanctions in a long-running dispute over water rights in the border region.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by A joint agreement appeared to avert a threat by President Trump of tariffs and sanctions in a long-running dispute over water rights in the border region. By Chris Cameron and James Wagner Chris Cameron reported from Washington and James Wagner from Mexico City. Mexico has agreed to send water to the United States and temporarily channel more water to the country from their shared rivers, a concession that appeared to defuse a diplomatic crisis sparked by yearslong shortages that left Mexico behind on its treaty-bound contribution of water from the borderlands. Earlier this month, President Trump threatened additional tariffs and other sanctions against Mexico over the water debt, amounting to about 420 billion gallons. In a social media post, Mr. Trump accused Mexico of “stealing” water from Texas farmers by not meeting its obligations under a 1944 treaty that mediates the distribution of water from three rivers the two countries share: the Rio Grande, the Colorado and the Tijuana. In an agreement announced jointly by Mexico and the United States on Monday, Mexico will immediately transfer some of its water reserves and will give the country a larger share of the flow of water from the Rio Grande through October. The concession from Mexico averted the threat of more punishing tariffs and diplomatic enmity with the United States amid the rollout of Mr. Trump’s new trade policies. But fulfilling the agreement is expected to significantly strain Mexico’s farmlands and could revive civil unrest triggered by previous water payments to the United States. Much of the Mexican borderlands are enduring extreme drought conditions, according to Mexico’s meteorological agency and water commission, and Mexico’s water reserves are at historic lows. Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has taken a conciliatory approach in negotiations with the Trump administration. Hours after Mr. Trump’s threat of tariffs over the water dispute earlier this month, Ms. Sheinbaum acknowledged that her country had fallen short of its treaty commitments, citing the extreme drought and saying that Mexico had been complying “to the extent of water availability.” In a statement on Monday, the State Department lauded Ms. Sheinbaum “for her personal involvement” in negotiating the agreement, and spoke of “water scarcity affecting communities on both sides of the border.” A statement from the Mexican foreign ministry on the agreement noted that the United States had agreed not to seek a renegotiation of the 1944 water treaty. Longstanding tensions over water have simmered between Mexico and the United States. In 2020, those tensions exploded into violence in Mexico, as farmers rioted and seized control of a dam in the border region in an effort to shut off water deliveries to the United States. Rising temperatures and drought have made the water from rivers Mexico and the United States share all the more valuable. According to data provided by the International Boundary and Water Commission, which mediates water disputes between the two countries, Mexico has fallen well short of its treaty commitments on water delivery in the last five years. Between October 2020 and October 2024, Mexico provided just over 400,000 acre-feet of water, far less than the roughly 1.4 million acre-feet called for under treaty stipulations. The debt has only grown since. Emiliano Rodríguez Mega contributed reporting from Mexico City.

"The move comes as President Trump has tried to abolish D.E.I. programs at universities.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The move comes as President Trump has tried to abolish D.E.I. programs at universities. By Stephanie Saul Reporting from Boston Harvard is revamping its diversity, equity and inclusion office in a move that seemed to accede to the Trump administration, even as the university has sued the administration and accused it of unlawfully interfering in the university’s affairs. An email to the Harvard community on Monday announced that the office had been renamed the Office of Community and Campus Life. The decision follows similar reorganizations across the country by universities, which appeared to be aimed at placating conservative critics who have attacked diversity offices as left-wing indoctrination factories. Harvard’s announcement stood out, though, because it came just hours after lawyers for the university and the Trump administration held their first conference in a lawsuit in which Harvard accuses the administration of invading freedoms long recognized by the Supreme Court. The Trump administration also opened another front in its fight with the university on Monday, accusing the Harvard Law Review, an independent student-run journal, of racial discrimination in journal membership and article selection. In a news release announcing that the law review was under investigation, Craig Trainor, the Department of Education’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said the journal “appears to pick winners and losers on the basis of race, employing a spoils system in which the race of the legal scholar is as, if not more, important than the merit of the submission.” Responding to the announcement, Harvard Law School emphasized its commitment to ensuring that programs it oversees comply with the law, but pointed out that the journal is legally independent. A similar claim against the Harvard Law Review was dismissed in federal court in 2019. In announcing that Harvard's diversity office was being revamped, Sherri Ann Charleston, formerly the chief diversity officer, said the university should bring people together based on their backgrounds and perspectives and “not the broad demographic groups to which they belong.” Dr. Charleston’s title has been changed to chief community and campus life officer. The Trump administration included abolishing D.E.I. efforts in a long list of demands it sent to Harvard two weeks ago, which the university would have to meet to continue receiving federal funding. Among other requirements, the administration ordered Harvard to appoint an external overseer to monitor students, faculty and staff for “viewpoint diversity,” to ban international students hostile to “American values,” and to eliminate activist faculty. The list of demands was sent by mistake, according to two people familiar with the matter, but the White House has continued to stand by the requirements. Harvard responded to the demands by filing the lawsuit in federal court. “No government, regardless of which party, should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” Harvard’s president, Alan M. Garber, wrote in a statement to the university. In retaliation, the administration has frozen more than $2.2 billion in university grants and contracts. Miles J. Herszenhorn contributed reporting. Stephanie Saul reports on colleges and universities, with a recent focus on the dramatic changes in college admissions and the debate around diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education.

"The planned concessions to give automakers more time to relocate production to the United States would still leave substantial tariffs on imported cars and car parts.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by The planned concessions to give automakers more time to relocate production to the United States would still leave substantial tariffs on imported cars and car parts. By Ana Swanson and Jack Ewing The Trump administration said it plans to announce measures as early as Tuesday to ease the effects of tariffs on imported cars and car parts to give automakers more time to relocate production to the United States. Tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and on auto parts will remain in place. But the tariffs will be modified so that they are not “stacked” with other tariffs, for example on steel and aluminum, a White House spokesman said. Automakers will not have to pay tariffs on those metals, widely used in automobiles, on top of the tariffs on cars and parts. In addition, automakers will be reimbursed for some of the cost of tariffs on imported components. The reimbursement will amount to up to 3.75 percent of the value of a new car in the first year, but will be phased out over two years, the spokesman confirmed. A 25 percent tariff on imported cars took effect April 3. On Saturday, the tariffs are set to be extended to include imported parts. “President Trump is building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and our great American workers,” Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said in a statement. “This deal is a major victory for the president’s trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically, while providing runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand their domestic manufacturing.” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said at a news conference on Tuesday morning that Trump would sign an executive order related to auto tariffs later in the day. At the same briefing, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent declined to share details of any relief that automakers might get from tariffs but said that the policy would be focused on encouraging them to bring more production back to the United States. Even with the planned changes, there will still be substantial tariffs on imported cars and auto parts, which will raise prices for new and used cars by thousands of dollars and increase the cost of repairs and insurance premiums. The modification to the tariffs was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Lutnick helped automakers secure a major exemption from tariffs in March and has taken on a role advocating relief for some industries hit by the levies. Automakers welcomed the change. “We believe the president’s leadership is helping level the playing field for companies like G.M. and allowing us to invest even more in the U.S. economy,” Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said in a statement on Monday. “We appreciate the productive conversations with the president and his administration and look forward to continuing to work together.” Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.

Kovaleski It was May 1996, and David Kaczynski, a counselor for troubled youth in upstate New York, sat down to write a letter to his brother Ted. A month earlier, his brother had been shockingly unmasked as the shadowy Unabomber, responsible for a 17-year campaign of bombings that had killed and maimed people across the country. Ted Kaczynski, a brilliant but mentally troubled mathematician who had retreated years earlier to a remote hovel in Montana, had been arrested based on information from a tipster to the F.B.I., ending one of the longest and most expensive manhunts in American history. He was now in custody and facing what would almost certainly be a lifetime behind bars, if not a death sentence. The tipster was David. Sitting in his home in Schenectady, N.Y., David began writing the letter. He used a pencil, knowing he might have to erase before he got it right. “I could only imagine how much Ted resented me,” he recalled in an interview. Would Ted consider allowing him to visit, he wrote, and try to explain? “I wanted to tell him in person that we morally felt an obligation to stop the violence,” he said. Ted declined to put David on his visitors list, and when he wrote back, it was to turn the fury of his resentment on his brother. “You will go to hell because, for you, seeing yourself as you really are will truly be hell,” he wrote.

But various obstacles could hinder the effort. Construction for a residential development in Henderson, Nev. The bulk of federal land is in the West, meaning an effort to build on it could help ease housing prices in states like Nevada.Credit...Morgan Lieberman for The New York Times Supported by By Madeleine Ngo Reporting from Washington During his presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump pledged to quickly bring down prices for American households, including making housing more affordable. “We’re going to open up tracts of federal land for housing construction,” Mr. Trump said in August. “We desperately need housing for people who can’t afford what’s going on now.” The Trump administration is now trying to follow through on that promise. Last month, federal officials created a task force that would identify and release federal land that could be used for housing development. The announcement is the first major initiative the Trump administration has rolled out to address the nation’s affordable housing crisis. It is an idea that has bipartisan support. Both Mr. Trump and Kamala Harris, the former vice president and Democratic nominee for president, have supported efforts to build affordable housing on certain federal lands. Housing developers and researchers say the idea of making more federal land available for housing development holds some promise for Western states like Nevada and California, where the bulk of federal land is. But the initiative would do little to increase housing supply in other parts of the country where residents also struggle with high shelter costs, such as New York and Miami. Other challenges also exist before any housing can be built. Most of the federal government’s land lacks the necessary water and sewer infrastructure to support residential communities. Environmental groups have also voiced concern over the administration’s intent to sell public land because of its potential effect on wildlife habitat.

"World Liberty Financial has eviscerated the boundary between private enterprise and government policy in ways without precedent in modern American history.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Trump Administration  World Liberty Financial has eviscerated the boundary between private enterprise and government policy in ways without precedent in modern American history. Credit...Illustrations by Ricardo Tomás Supported by By Eric LiptonDavid Yaffe-Bellany and Ben Protess The pitch from “ZMoney” arrived on the encrypted messaging app Signal just days before Donald J. Trump’s presidential inauguration. “ZMoney” was Zachary Folkman, an entrepreneur who once ran a company called Date Hotter Girls and was now representing World Liberty Financial, the cryptocurrency firm that Mr. Trump and his sons had recently unveiled. Mr. Folkman was writing to a crypto startup in the Cayman Islands, offering a “partnership” in which the firms would buy each other’s digital coins, a deal that would bolster the startup’s public profile. But there was a catch, The New York Times found. For the privilege of associating with the Trumps, the startup would have to make, in effect, a secret multimillion dollar payment to World Liberty. “Everything we do gets a lot of exposure and credibility,” Mr. Folkman wrote, asserting that other business partners had committed between $10 million and $30 million to World Liberty. The Cayman startup rejected the offer, as did several other firms that received a similar pitch from World Liberty, executives said. They considered the deal unethical, concluding that World Liberty was essentially selling an endorsement — and hiding the arrangement from the public. World Liberty’s executives, who have maintained that they did nothing improper, were undeterred. They successfully pitched similar deals to other firms while also marketing their coin to buyers around the world, reaping more than $550 million in sales, with a large cut earmarked for the president’s family.

"The Maryland Democrat accused the president of “gross violations of the Constitution and due process rights” and demanded the return of an immigrant and Maryland resident imprisoned in El Salvador.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The Maryland Democrat accused the president of “gross violations of the Constitution and due process rights” and demanded the return of an immigrant and Maryland resident imprisoned in El Salvador. By Robert Jimison Reporting from Washington Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, made a personal request on Tuesday to President Trump to return a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident who was mistakenly deported last month and remains imprisoned in El Salvador, accusing Mr. Trump of “gross violations of the Constitution and due process rights” in Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s case. In the lengthy letter, Mr. Van Hollen scolded Mr. Trump for willfully ignoring a Supreme Court decision instructing his administration to “facilitate” the man’s return. Justice Department lawyers said not long after Mr. Abrego Garcia’s removal that his deportation had been an “administrative error.” Mr. Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador last week and was allowed to meet briefly with Mr. Abrego Garcia after the government arranged for him to be temporarily released from a Salvadoran detention center. Mr. Van Hollen gave Mr. Trump a detailed recounting of his meeting with Vice President Félix Ulloa of El Salvador, noting that their conversations made clear that his country had “no independent legal basis” to imprison Mr. Abrego Garcia and had done so only because of a financial deal with the Trump administration to hold any deportee it sends. “The Trump administration’s whole argument is this sham claim that El Salvador is a sovereign country and it’s up to them whether or not Abrego Garcia gets released,” Mr. Van Hollen said in an interview. “But the government of El Salvador says exactly the opposite.” In the letter, Mr. Van Hollen wrote that he believed that Salvadoran officials would release Mr. Abrego Garcia if the Trump administration requested it. “Obviously, your administration could say El Salvador was no longer contractually obligated to imprison Mr. Abrego Garcia. Then El Salvador can release him, and Attorney General Bondi can, as promised, send the plane,” Mr. Van Hollen wrote, referencing remarks Ms. Bondi made during an Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador earlier this month. But Ms. Bondi later told reporters that Mr. Abrego Garcia would not be returned, asserting that Salvadoran officials were unwilling to release him. “He is not coming back to our country,” she said during a news conference at the Justice Department. “President Bukele said he was not sending him back. That’s the end of the story.” Mr. Van Hollen argued that the implications of Mr. Abrego Garcia’s plight extend far beyond one individual. “While Mr. Abrego Garcia is at the center of this case, its consequences impact the due process rights of everyone who lives in America,” he wrote. “If your administration can strip away the constitutional rights of one man in defiance of court orders, it can do it to all of us.” Advertisement","trump administration maryland democrat accused president gross violations constitution due process rights demanded return immigrant maryland resident imprisoned el salvador robert jimison reporting washington senator chris van hollen democrat maryland made personal request tuesday president trump return salvadoran national maryland resident mistakenly deported last month remains imprisoned el salvador accusing mr trump gross violations constitution due process rights kilmar armando abrego garcia case lengthy letter mr van hollen scolded mr trump willfully ignoring supreme court decision instructing administration facilitate man return justice department lawyers said long mr abrego garcia removal deportation administrative error mr van hollen traveled el salvador last week allowed meet briefly mr abrego garcia government arranged temporarily released salvadoran detention center mr van hollen gave mr trump detailed recounting meeting vice president f lix ulloa el salvador noting conversations made clear country independent legal basis imprison mr abrego garcia done financial deal trump administration hold deportee sends trump administration whole argument sham claim el salvador sovereign country whether abrego garcia gets released mr van hollen said interview government el salvador says exactly opposite letter mr van hollen wrote believed salvadoran officials release mr abrego garcia trump administration requested obviously administration say el salvador longer contractually obligated imprison mr abrego garcia el salvador can release attorney general bondi can promised send plane mr van hollen wrote referencing remarks ms bondi made oval office meeting mr trump president nayib bukele el salvador earlier month ms bondi later told reporters mr abrego garcia returned asserting salvadoran officials unwilling release coming back country said news conference justice department president bukele said sending back end story mr van hollen argued implications mr abrego garcia plight extend far beyond one individual mr abrego garcia center case consequences impact due process rights everyone lives america wrote administration can strip away constitutional rights one man defiance court orders can us"

But his speech at a rally was dark and filled with grievance. By Luke Broadwater Luke Broadwater covers the White House and reported from Michigan. President Trump marked the first 100 days of his second term on Tuesday at a rally in Michigan in which he celebrated his border crackdown and boasted of the retribution he has carried out against his perceived enemies and his opponents’ inability to thwart his agenda. The president addressed about 3,000 of his supporters at Macomb Community College, in an area near Detroit seen as key to his electoral victory in the state and emblematic of union workers’ shift from the Democratic to the Republican Party. Mr. Trump was in campaign mode, peppering his sentences with false statements — such as the lie that the 2020 election had been stolen — exaggerations, jokes and insults. He mocked the way his predecessor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., looked in a bathing suit and encouraged the crowd to cheer to indicate which demeaning nickname for him they preferred: “Sleepy Joe” or “Crooked Joe.” “I miss the campaign,” Mr. Trump said at one point. The speech had been billed as a way for the president to build momentum for his economic policies, which have been dragging him down politically. The area in which Mr. Trump spoke held signs that said “Buy American. Hire American.” His expansive tariffs have hurt the stock market and contributed to a drop in his approval rating. A majority of Americans approved of Mr. Trump’s performance in office throughout January and February, but he is now struggling with what polls show is greater public disapproval. Those in the crowd cheered Mr. Trump’s agenda, and attendees said they supported his efforts to use tariffs to try to bring back manufacturing jobs to areas like Detroit, the home of the U.S. auto industry. The city has lost one-third of its population since 2000. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

By Linda Qiu Videos by Jamie Leventhal Reporting from Washington President Trump, intent on enacting an expansive agenda, has moved at a dizzying pace in the first 100 days of his term, issuing a barrage of executive actions and seeking to expand the scope of his presidential power. Underlying those efforts is a nonstop distortion of basic facts as Mr. Trump has sought to reconfigure the global economy, reshape the federal government and restrict immigration. To justify his executive actions and policies, Mr. Trump has relied on false, misleading and hyperbolic claims, deflecting blame for catastrophes, boasting about purported achievements and trying to seek leverage with Ukraine in negotiating a peace deal with Russia. Here is a fact-check of Mr. Trump’s often-repeated claims. In his breakneck effort to transform the federal bureaucracy, Mr. Trump has offered misleading justifications. He has often echoed dubious claims about so-called fraud made by Elon Musk, the billionaire leading the cost-cutting initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency. What Was Said “Could you mention some of the things that your team has found, some of the crazy numbers, including the woman that walked away with about $30 million?”

Amazon said it was “not going to happen.” By Shawn McCreesh and Karen Weise Shawn McCreesh reported from Washington, and Karen Weise from Seattle. President Trump’s 100th day in office started with what seemed to be a fresh and fast-escalating spat between the White House and Amazon. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, came out swinging in her press briefing on Tuesday morning, accusing Amazon of being “hostile and political” after a report — disputed by the company — from Punchbowl News saying that the online retail giant would start displaying the exact cost of tariff-related price increases alongside all its products. Displaying the import fees would have made clear to American consumers that they were shouldering the costs of Mr. Trump’s tariff policies rather than China, as he and his top officials have often claimed would be the case. After the report was published, Mr. Trump spoke about it over the phone with Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, according to three people familiar with the exchange. Amazon spokesmen hurriedly issued denials that the policy was going into effect, and by Tuesday afternoon Mr. Trump was back to praising Mr. Bezos. “Jeff Bezos is very nice,” Mr. Trump said to reporters as he embarked on a trip to Michigan for a rally commemorating the first 100 days of his second term. “He solved the problem very quickly. He did the right thing. Good guy.” This arc between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bezos that played out over just a few hours seemed telling. The Amazon mogul is among the billionaires who have gone to ever new lengths to get in good with this White House. Mr. Trump, in turn, has managed to woo such billionaires by promising he’d be better for business. And yet, at the first sign that Mr. Bezos might be prioritizing his businesses interests in a way that would harm Mr. Trump’s political fortunes, the White House didn’t hesitate to lash out publicly.

By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington Very early on a fall morning in 2017, F.B.I. agents knocked down the front door of a home in Atlanta with a battering ram. Guns drawn, they set off a flash-bang grenade and charged inside. The couple who lived there, Hilliard Toi Cliatt and Curtrina Martin, barricaded themselves in a closet. The agents dragged Mr. Cliatt out at gunpoint and handcuffed him. They told Ms. Martin to keep her hands up as she pleaded to see her 7-year-old son, who had been asleep in another room. As they questioned Mr. Cliatt, he gave his address. It was different from the one the agents had a warrant to enter. One of the agents, Lawrence Guerra, had earlier identified the correct house, which he said looked similar and was nearby, on a different street. He said he had been misdirected on the morning of the raid by his GPS device. The couple sued for false arrest, false imprisonment, assault, battery and other claims but lost in the lower courts on a variety of grounds, notably that government officials’ actions are protected from lawsuits when they perform a duty that involves discretion. The legal questions in the case heard by the Supreme Court on Tuesday were a tangled series of exceptions and provisos involving the Federal Tort Claims Act, which only sometimes allows suits against the government notwithstanding the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

"A series of dismissals by the Trump administration has flooded a little-known group of administrative judges who protect civil servants.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by A series of dismissals by the Trump administration has flooded a little-known group of administrative judges who protect civil servants. By Devlin Barrett Reporting from Washington Dozens of fired Justice Department lawyers are fighting their dismissals in court, part of a growing tsunami of legal cases arising from the Trump administration’s quest to slash the size of the government and rein in what the president and his advisers call the “deep state.” In just three months in office, the Trump administration has carried out mass firings across the government, provoking court battles over the parameters of executive power. At the Justice Department, the dismissals have been far more targeted, going after senior career officials who have served in administrations of both parties, as well as prosecutors who worked on investigations of President Trump and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. More than four dozen former Justice Department employees are appealing their dismissals to administrative judges — in what some experts in employment law consider a crucial new test of long-established law that may ultimately be settled by the Supreme Court. Last week, Adam Schleifer, a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles who was abruptly fired last month, filed legal papers challenging his dismissal. Mr. Schleifer, who handled white-collar investigations, was informed of his ouster by a brief email from the White House — an unheard-of circumstance for generations of Justice Department lawyers. Former federal employees seeking to fight their dismissals must first file appeals with the Merit Systems Protection Board, where administrative judges weigh the reasons for the firings before issuing rulings. Those rulings, however, can be appealed to federal courts in Washington. The merit board’s mission is to uphold civil service protections, which are intended to ensure competence and fairness in government. Federal case law has long held that civil servants may not be fired for partisan reasons, for blowing the whistle on misconduct or simply to clear out positions to fill with loyalists. The Trump administration is now testing those precedents and principles. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"Most levies on imported cars and car parts will remain in place, but automakers have secured some relaxation of the trade policy.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by Most levies on imported cars and car parts will remain in place, but automakers have secured some relaxation of the trade policy. By Ana Swanson and Jack Ewing President Trump signed a pair of executive orders on Tuesday that walked back some tariffs for carmakers, removing levies that Ford, General Motors and others have complained would backfire on U.S. manufacturing by raising the cost of production and squeezing their profits. The changes will modify Mr. Trump’s tariffs so carmakers that pay a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, for example on steel and aluminum, or on certain imports from Canada and Mexico, according to the orders. However, the rules do not appear to protect automakers from tariffs on steel and aluminum that their suppliers pay and pass on. Carmakers will also be able to qualify for tariff relief for a proportion of the cost of their imported components, though those benefits will be phased out over the next two years. At a rally in Michigan on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said that he was showing “a little flexibility” to the automakers but that he wanted them to make their components in the United States. “We gave them a little time before we slaughter them if they don’t do this,” he said. The decision to reduce the scope of the tariffs is the latest sign that the Trump administration’s decision to impose stiff levies on nearly all trading partners has created challenges and economic uncertainty for American companies. But even with the concessions announced Tuesday, administration policies will add thousands of dollars to car prices and endanger the financial health of automakers and their suppliers, analysts said. Mr. Trump signed the executive orders aboard Air Force One as he flew to Michigan, home to America’s largest automakers, for a speech marking his 100 days in office.

"The investigations by the Government Accountability Office come as the White House looks to expand its power over the federal budget.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The investigations by the Government Accountability Office come as the White House looks to expand its power over the federal budget. By Tony Romm Reporting from Washington An independent federal watchdog has opened more than three dozen investigations into the Trump administration to determine if it has illegally withheld billions of dollars in congressionally approved funds, raising the odds of a high-stakes constitutional clash over the power of the government’s purse. The acknowledgment by the Government Accountability Office came on Tuesday, as House and Senate Democrats estimated for the first time that President Trump might have blocked the delivery of at least $430 billion during his first 100 days in office. That imperiled money enacted for foreign aid, green energy, health and transportation-related programs, potentially in violation of the law. The dispute originates in Mr. Trump’s vast, chaotic and continued reconfiguration of the federal government. Since the first days of Mr. Trump’s term, he and his top advisers — including the tech billionaire Elon Musk — have shuttered programs while blocking or slowing a wide array of funds seen as wasteful, unnecessary or incompatible with the president’s broader political agenda. Many Democrats and legal scholars contend that Mr. Trump’s budget maneuvers violate the Constitution, which vest the powers to tax and spend with Congress, not the executive branch. The spending interruptions have also prompted a wave of court challenges as state officials, nonprofits and other federal aid recipients say the White House has acted illegally. On Tuesday, Gene L. Dodaro, the comptroller general of the Government Accountability Office, revealed at a congressional hearing that his office had opened “39 different investigations” into the administration. He suggested some of the focus was on cuts or changes to spending at the Education Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and other major federal offices. Under a 1970s law, the Government Accountability Office has the power to investigate whether an administration has improperly withheld authorized funding in defiance of Congress. The watchdog has the power to sue if it finds the administration illegally impounds funds. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"G.O.P. leaders used a procedural maneuver to close off an avenue for House members to demand answers from the Trump administration, including on the defense secretary’s use of Signal.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Signal Leaks Advertisement Supported by G.O.P. leaders used a procedural maneuver to close off an avenue for House members to demand answers from the Trump administration, including on the defense secretary’s use of Signal. By Michael Gold Reporting from the Capitol House Republicans on Tuesday quietly closed off a way for members of Congress to force votes demanding information from the Trump administration, the latest instance of the G.O.P. preemptively ceding the legislative branch’s powers to avoid challenging President Trump. The move temporarily blocked an effort by Democrats on the Armed Services Committee to compel the administration to provide information on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of private Signal group chats to discuss military matters, including strikes on Yemen. It also froze in place more than a dozen other resolutions Democrats have introduced in the past few months demanding answers from Mr. Trump’s team about its slashing of the federal bureaucracy and what Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency were doing inside federal agencies. Republican leaders accomplished the maneuver by tucking language into a procedural measure needed to begin debate on unrelated legislation, which passed on a party-line vote. It was the third time in the past two months that they have availed themselves of an arcane strategy to help their members skirt politically thorny votes that might have forced them to show their views of controversies in the Trump administration. Republicans have twice pushed through language that temporarily barred lawmakers from forcing a vote on President Trump’s tariffs, shielding their members from having to weigh in on his trade policies that have alarmed some constituents and donors. As a result, lawmakers in the House cannot force a vote on undoing Mr. Trump’s tariffs until October at the earliest. The vote on Tuesday would stop the House from voting on “resolutions of inquiry,” measures that formally request information from the executive branch. Those measures are governed by special rules that can allow House members to force a vote on them if they have not been addressed by the committee overseeing them within a certain period of time. Democrats have filed several such resolutions, which have been defeated in committee votes. The Armed Services Committee has not taken up the resolution targeting Mr. Hegseth’s use of Signal since it was introduced at the end of March, and the deadline for its consideration is approaching. The language approved on Tuesday would declare the period from the day of approval until Sept. 30 one long calendar day for the purpose of resolutions of inquiry, making it impossible for them to ripen and be forced to the floor until at least October. House Republican leaders inserted the language into a measure needed to bring up five measures undoing Biden-era environmental regulations. Democrats used similar procedural changes to blunt resolutions of inquiry between 2020 and 2022, when they controlled the House. Michael Gold covers Congress for The Times, with a focus on immigration policy and congressional oversight.

"The termination of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants from the agency has left its programs, which address an array of needs, in turmoil.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The termination of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants from the agency has left its programs, which address an array of needs, in turmoil. By Aishvarya Kavi Reporting from Washington More than 20 states sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over the dismantling of the federal agency focused on volunteerism, including the elimination of hundreds of millions of dollars in grant funding for the states and the termination of almost all federal employees. The lawsuit called the cuts “an unauthorized decision by the administration to dismantle” the agency, known as AmeriCorps, after Congress wrote its programs into law decades ago and had funded them annually. The cuts have jeopardized education, anti-poverty and disaster recovery community service programs across the country. “My question to this administration is: Is nothing sacred? Is nothing worth protecting?” Philip J. Weiser, the attorney general of Colorado, one of the states that sued, said in a virtual joint news conference on Tuesday. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. On Friday, AmeriCorps suddenly canceled nearly $400 million in grants, an estimated 40 percent of its remaining funding, according to the nonprofit that represents AmeriCorps’ state and national commissions, as the Trump administration continued its rapid dismantling of the agency. The cuts — spread among all 50 states, several territories and Washington, D.C. — would shutter more than 1,000 programs and abruptly end the service of more than 32,000 AmeriCorps workers, said the nonprofit, called America’s Service Commissions. “It has been determined that your award no longer effectuates agency priorities,” said an email to the commissions, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times. “You must immediately cease all award activities. This is a final agency action and is not administratively appealable.” Some states, including Alabama, California, Oregon and Wyoming, had all their funding cut, America’s Service Commissions said. States experienced the biggest cuts because they get the majority of AmeriCorps funds — about 80 percent. The programs funded by that money undergo a rigorous process to win grants, in which the groups are pitted against one another and are obligated to partly match the funds.

"Patrick Vereb is accused of taking over $650,000 from customers who paid for dog and cat burial and cremation services between 2021 and 2024 in Western Pennsylvania.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Patrick Vereb is accused of taking over $650,000 from customers who paid for dog and cat burial and cremation services between 2021 and 2024 in Western Pennsylvania. By Johnny Diaz The owner of a Pittsburgh funeral home dumped the remains of thousands of dogs and cats in a landfill after their owners had paid more than $650,000 for their cremation and burial — then handed them back the ashes of unknown animals, according to prosecutors in Pennsylvania. Patrick Vereb, 70, the owner of Vereb Funeral Home and Eternity Pet Memorial in Pittsburgh, was charged on Monday with felony counts of theft by deception, receiving stolen property and deceptive business practices, the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General said in a statement. Mr. Vereb surrendered Monday afternoon to the authorities and was arraigned on the charges. He was released on his own recognizance, prosecutors said. A lawyer for Mr. Vereb did not immediately respond to inquiries on Tuesday. Mr. Vereb has a court hearing scheduled for May 9, according to court documents. He is accused of stealing from over 6,500 customers who paid for the burial and cremation services of their pets from 2021 to 2024, prosecutors said. “This case is disturbing, and will cause devastation and heartache for many Pennsylvanians,” said Dave Sunday, the state’s attorney general. “Our pets are members of our families, and this defendant betrayed and agonized pet owners who entrusted him to provide dignified services for their beloved cats and dogs.” A spokesman for the attorney general’s office said on Tuesday that a former employee of Mr. Vereb’s tipped off the office and prompted the investigation. The attorney general’s office said that nearly a dozen veterinary practices and businesses helped in confirming that Mr. Vereb had collected at least $657,517 in fees from pet owners who were promised a private cremation for their pet, but did not receive their actual ashes. Instead, Mr. Vereb disposed of many of the pets at a landfill whose location was not disclosed and provided customers with the ashes of other animals, prosecutors said. They did not say where the ashes had come from. The attorney general’s office said that it has identified thousands of customers from Allegheny, Armstrong, Washington and Westmoreland Counties in Western Pennsylvania as victims. A spokesman for the office said it does not provide information about victims. But Dustin Betlem, who runs Betlem Veterinary Services in Oakdale, Pa., said, “We are absolutely appalled and devastatingly blindsided by this scandal.” Dr. Betlem added, “Needless to say we were clients of Eternity Pet Memorial from then until about two weeks ago.” Because of the large number of customers who may have been impacted, the attorney general’s office has launched a website to connect with victims who can share their impact statements and receive updates on the case. On its website, the Vereb Funeral Home and Eternity Pet Memorial offered that “compassionate experts” would take care of their customers’ needs for pet funeral and memorial services. “Our mission is to assist families in creating personalized funeral experiences that honor the life of their loved ones,” the website said.

"“Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicized,” Mr. Emhoff said in reaction to the removal of him and senior Biden White House officials from the board that oversees the museum.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by “Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicized,” Mr. Emhoff said in reaction to the removal of him and senior Biden White House officials from the board that oversees the museum. By Katie Glueck and Tyler Pager The Trump administration has begun firing at least some of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s appointees to the board that oversees the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, including Douglas Emhoff, the husband of former Vice President Kamala Harris, and other senior Biden White House officials. “Today, I was informed of my removal from the United States Holocaust Memorial Council,” Mr. Emhoff said in a statement on Tuesday. “Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicized. To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous — and it dishonors the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve.” Mr. Emhoff is Jewish and an outspoken critic of the rise in antisemitism. His appointment to the council was announced in January; presidential appointments are typically five-year terms. The other officials who were dismissed include Ron Klain, Mr. Biden’s first chief of staff; Tom Perez, the former labor secretary and senior adviser to Mr. Biden; Susan Rice, the national security adviser to former President Barack Obama and Mr. Biden’s top domestic policy adviser who led a major national strategic effort to counter antisemitism; and Anthony Bernal, a senior adviser to Jill Biden, the former first lady. All of their appointments were announced in January. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a statement that “President Trump looks forward to appointing new individuals who will not only continue to honor the memory of those who perished in the Holocaust, but who are also steadfast supporters of the State of Israel.” The White House did not immediately respond to questions about how the administration defined what it meant to be a steadfast supporter of Israel, or what precipitated the firings.

"In a 2-to-1 ruling, a panel of appellate judges restored a district court’s injunction preventing the Trump administration from laying off 90 percent of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s staff.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Federal Layoffs Advertisement Supported by In a 2-to-1 ruling, a panel of appellate judges restored a district court’s injunction preventing the Trump administration from laying off 90 percent of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s staff. By Stacy Cowley Stacy Cowley has reported on the consumer bureau since 2016. Federal judges have again intervened to temporarily stave off mass layoffs at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the watchdog agency that oversees banks and enforces a wide range of consumer protection laws. On Monday afternoon, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a 2-to-1 ruling barring the latest attempt by Trump officials to fire nearly 1,500 workers, around 90 percent of the agency’s staff. Russell T. Vought, the White House budget office director who is also the consumer bureau’s acting director, first tried in February to fire almost all employees at the bureau, which he has called a “woke and weaponized” agency. Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the Federal District Court in Washington blocked the move, calling it an illegal attempt to dismantle the agency. Congress created the C.F.P.B. in 2011 to bolster the safeguards for consumer financial products like bank accounts and mortgages, and only Congress can abolish it. On April 11, the appeals court’s panel unanimously threw out parts of Judge Jackson’s decision, ruling the consumer bureau’s leaders could lay workers off if they decided, after a careful evaluation, that specific employees were not needed to carry out the agency’s legally mandated tasks. Days later, Mr. Vought’s team sent termination notices to all but 200 workers. Judge Jackson again blocked the firings and ordered a hearing to determine if the careful assessment required by the appeals court had actually taken place. The government asked the appellate court to cancel Judge Jackson’s hearing and permit the layoffs to go forward. In recent days, a union representing the bureau staff filed hundreds of pages of internal agency records and employee testimonials to the district court illustrating Trump officials’ hurry to fire workers and predicting that the layoffs would obliterate the agency’s ability to operate. Members of Mr. Vought’s team have maintained in court papers that they did complete the court-ordered assessment and stood by the conclusion that the agency could function with just 10 percent of its staff. Citing those “ongoing disputes,” the appellate panel on Monday said it had decided to preserve Judge Jackson’s temporary ban on layoffs until at least May 16, when the appeals court is scheduled to hear oral arguments. That will ensure the bureau’s union and other suing parties “can receive meaningful final relief” if they prevail in court, the judges wrote. Judge Jackson canceled her hearing, which was to be held on Tuesday, and said she would take no further action on the case until the appeals court ruled. Judges Gregory G. Katsas, who was appointed to the appellate court by President Trump during his first term, and Cornelia Pillard, an Obama appointee, joined the majority ruling. Judge Neomi Rao, another Trump appointee, dissented. Bureau workers celebrated the temporary reprieve. “Once again, C.F.P.B. workers have fought back against this administration’s attacks on our consumer protection mission,” Cat Farman, the staff union’s president, said in a written statement. Stacy Cowley is a business reporter who writes about a broad array of topics related to consumer finance, including student debt, the banking industry and small business.

The dead ranged in age from 7 to 18. By Julie Bosman Patrick McCarthy, the village manager in Chatham, Ill., was at his office on Monday afternoon when he heard the wails of so many sirens in his town of 14,000 people that he knew something was terribly wrong. When he and a co-worker rushed to the scene a few blocks away, they saw what appeared to have been a violent and inexplicable accident: A car had plowed through a field, avoiding trees and pillars, and crashed through an after-school center. Three children and one teenager, ranging in age from 7 to 18, were killed. “Hopefully that’s what it was, an accident,” Mr. McCarthy said. “Today we’re just kind of going through and trying to figure out what do we do next after something like this happens.” The Illinois State Police said on Tuesday that the driver of the vehicle was a 44-year-old resident of Chatham. ​The resident is not in custody, the police said, and the cause of the crash remains under investigation. Calls to the resident’s home went unanswered on Tuesday. Toxicology reports are pending, the authorities said, adding that the crash did not initially appear to be a “targeted attack.” In Chatham, a bedroom community about a 20-minute drive from the state capital of Springfield, residents wrestled on Tuesday with grief and horror over the crash. Y.N.O.T. Outdoors, the operator of the after-school program, was well known in town as a popular place for afternoon child care and summer camp, allowing parents with jobs to juggle work and family responsibilities.

By Anemona Hartocollis and Vimal Patel A Harvard task force released a scathing account of the university on Tuesday, finding that antisemitism had infiltrated coursework, social life, the hiring of some faculty members and the worldview of certain academic programs. A separate report on anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian bias on campus, also released on Tuesday, found widespread discomfort and alienation among those students as well, with 92 percent of Muslim survey respondents saying they believed they would face an academic or professional penalty for expressing their political opinions. The findings, conveyed in densely packed reports that are hundreds of pages long, come at a delicate time for the university. Harvard is being scrutinized by the Trump administration over accusations of antisemitism, and is fighting the administration’s withdrawal of billions of dollars in federal funding. Harvard has sued the Trump administration in hopes of restoring the funding, the first university to do so. Other schools that have been targeted by the administration are watching the litigation closely. In a letter accompanying the two reports, Dr. Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, apologized for the problems that the task forces revealed. He said the Hamas attack on Israel in 2023 and the war that followed had brought long simmering tensions to the surface, and promised to address them. “The 2023-24 academic year was disappointing and painful,” Dr. Garber, who took office in January 2024, wrote in the letter. “I am sorry for the moments when we failed to meet the high expectations we rightfully set for our community.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

No, oh my God. Oh my God. Holy [expletive]. By Christine Hauser The high-powered speedboat skimmed across Lake Havasu in Arizona, its throttle pressed harder and harder by its operator until the boat reached more than 200 mp.h. Then the boat was sucked into the air by its own aerodynamic design and flipped repeatedly before slamming back into the water. Spectators at the Desert Storm race on Saturday were stunned into silence, aside from some gasps and expletives, according to video that was widely shared online and picked up by national media organizations. Shortly after the boat came to rest upright in the water, its driver and throttle man, who were not named but are known by their race aliases as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, emerged from the cockpit. The driver had a broken collarbone and fractured ribs, and the throttle man had a fractured knee, said Ryan Olah, a crew member with the boat’s team, Freedom One Racing. “Their injuries were minor,” he said, “all things considering.” Mr. Olah said they joked around in the hospital, even after their boat had soared 60 feet high and flown an estimated 1,000 feet in about five seconds. “They said it happened so fast that all they can remember is getting banged around a little bit, popping the hatch and getting out,” Mr. Olah said. The men, both in their 50s, declined to be interviewed. Fans of speedboat racing in the United States have seen such acrobatics before, although perhaps not as dramatic as this one, said Ray Lee, the publisher of Speedboat Magazine, who was at the starting line while his videographer recorded nearby. Videos of the event, held on a windy day on the lake, racked up millions of views. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"The nation’s most populous county was already juggling legal liabilities, wildfire costs and threats to federal funding. Now its largest union is holding a 48-hour strike.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The nation’s most populous county was already juggling legal liabilities, wildfire costs and threats to federal funding. Now its largest union is holding a 48-hour strike. By Shawn Hubler Public hospitals diverted ambulances. Beach crews cleared wildfire debris without heavy equipment. Libraries closed. Thousands of nurses stayed home. A two-day strike in Los Angeles County kept some 55,000 unionized public employees off the job on Tuesday, as workers gathered at an enormous rally that clogged streets in downtown Los Angeles. The walkout by the public employees union, SEIU Local 721, came as contract negotiations between the nation’s largest county and the county’s largest union snagged in the face of intense budget pressures. Both the city and county governments in Los Angeles have struggled in recent months to deal with an onslaught of financial problems, including huge legal liabilities, threats to federal funding under the Trump administration and the cost of the January wildfires. Last week, city officials — who stretched last year to grant their unions generous pay raises — traveled to Sacramento to ask state legislators for help with a projected shortfall of nearly $1 billion. Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles warned that without a state rescue, the city might have to lay off some 1,650 workers. Los Angeles County, a much larger entity that acts as the social safety net for millions of Southern Californians, announced this month that its financial stressors were also mounting. Among them: projected wildfire-related costs approaching $2 billion; hundreds of millions of dollars in health grants that have been jeopardized by the Trump administration; and a $4 billion settlement for thousands of sex abuse claims brought by former wards of the county’s foster care and juvenile detention systems, dating back decades.

"A lawyer said he had used the cartoon image of a dragon in a business suit as a logo for his firm, Dragon Lawyers, to symbolize “aggressive representation.”",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by A lawyer said he had used the cartoon image of a dragon in a business suit as a logo for his firm, Dragon Lawyers, to symbolize “aggressive representation.” By Michael Levenson A purple dragon dressed in a business suit seemed like a natural choice for a logo when Jacob A. Perrone, a lawyer in East Lansing, Mich., recently opened a new firm and named it Dragon Lawyers. He noted that some lawyers liked to call themselves “bulldogs” and said the dragon symbolized “aggressive representation.” But a federal magistrate judge, Ray Kent, was not impressed. He was so disgusted by the dragon that he struck a lawsuit filed by Mr. Perrone on behalf of an inmate who had accused jail officials in Clinton County, Mich., of being “deliberately indifferent” to her when she started vomiting last year. In a brief order issued on Monday, Judge Kent noted that “each page of plaintiff’s complaint appears on an e-filing which is dominated by a large multicolored cartoon dragon dressed in a suit, presumably because she is represented by the law firm of ‘Dragon Lawyers PC © Award Winning Lawyers.’” “Use of this dragon cartoon logo is not only distracting, it is juvenile and impertinent,” Judge Kent wrote. “The Court is not a cartoon.” Judge Kent gave the woman, who was identified only as Jane Doe No. 2, until May 5 to refile her lawsuit “without the cartoon dragon.” He also ordered her not to file “any other documents with the cartoon dragon or other inappropriate content.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"Weeks after she hid from the cameras in the Oval Office, Gretchen Whitmer welcomed the president to her state as he delivered the federal funding she had sought for an air base.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Weeks after she hid from the cameras in the Oval Office, Gretchen Whitmer welcomed the president to her state as he delivered the federal funding she had sought for an air base. By Reid J. Epstein and Dave Philipps Reid J. Epstein reported from Washington, and Dave Philipps from Colorado Springs. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan is betting that the photo was worth it. When she went to the White House this month for her ill-fated meeting with President Trump — the one where she hid her face from a New York Times photographer — she had been trying to secure funding for an expansion of Selfridge Air National Guard Base near Detroit. So when Mr. Trump traveled to Michigan on Tuesday to announce on his 100th day in office that he was doing precisely what Ms. Whitmer had asked for, she had cause for a victory lap — despite the possible cost to her political prospects. She greeted him upon his arrival, creating another photo of them together, and then briefly stood beside him to make remarks thanking him for expanding the base. “The fact that we got it done — all the grief is worth it,” Ms. Whitmer said in an interview after the event on Tuesday. “The people of Michigan elected me twice because they know whether it’s threats or pundits ridiculing me for going to the White House, I’m always going to stand up for the people of Michigan.” In Michigan, Ms. Whitmer and her allies view the expansion at Selfridge as a big enough victory to be worth whatever personal humiliation she endured. The Defense Department will station about 20 F-15EX fighter jets at the base beginning in 2028, according to a document it circulated to Michigan’s senators. The new group of jets is a small fraction of the roughly 450 fighter jets in the Air National Guard, but many of those planes are old models. The F-15EX is the newest version of one of the U.S. military’s most versatile fighters. And even 20 jets can have a big economic impact on local communities because in addition to bringing in pilots, they can mean scores of security, maintenance and logistics jobs. Studies released by the military find that Air National Guard bases like Selfridge can contribute more than $100 million to a state’s economy. “This is a huge, bipartisan win for Michigan, decades in the making, that will grow our economy and make our country safer,” Ms. Whitmer said. “I appreciate the president’s partnership on this new fighter mission that will protect jobs and show the world that Michigan is the best place to pioneer the next innovations in national defense.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration cannot reduce or eliminate Head Start, because the program is funded by Congress.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration cannot reduce or eliminate Head Start, because the program is funded by Congress. By Sarah Mervosh The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have sued the Trump administration over what they say is a plan to illegally dismantle Head Start, the federal program that funds early education for America’s youngest and poorest children. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington State on Monday, was filed on behalf of Head Start associations and parent groups in several states. It argues that the Trump administration cannot reduce or eliminate Head Start, because the program is funded by Congress. Head Start, a $12 billion-a-year program, provides child care, preschool and other services for children in poverty from birth to age 5, before they start formal school. The program, under the Department of Health and Human Services, has been subject to spending cuts and layoffs as part of President Trump’s efforts to reduce federal spending. The Trump administration is expected to propose eliminating the Head Start program as part of its 2026 budget, which could be released as soon as this week, according to a series of draft documents reviewed by The New York Times. The White House previously said that no final funding decisions have been made, and any plan would require the support of Congress. But Jennesa Calvo-Friedman, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U, said the Trump administration had already found ways to diminish Head Start “through a series of executive actions which make it harder and harder for Head Start programs to stay open.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The defense secretary said the Women, Peace and Security program distracted from the core task of “war-fighting” and that the Pentagon would no longer participate in it.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The defense secretary said the Women, Peace and Security program distracted from the core task of “war-fighting” and that the Pentagon would no longer participate in it. By Helene Cooper National security reporter Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth boasted on Tuesday that he had “proudly” canceled a program that seeks to encourage more women to take part in national security issues. The Women, Peace and Security Act was signed into law back in 2017 by none other than the man who is Mr. Hegseth’s boss today, President Trump. The program looks to increase the role of women in preventing and resolving conflicts all over the world. Mr. Hegseth, in a post on the social media platform X, called the program “yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative that overburdens our commanders and troops — distracting from our core task: WAR-FIGHTING.” As defense secretary, Mr. Hegseth does not have the authority to rewrite or overturn laws, but he said that from here on in, the Pentagon would carry out the minimum requirements of the program and work to end it. He added, “Good riddance, WPS.” The U.S. military services have tried to carry out the program’s goals in different ways. The Air Force, for instance, has asked commanders to recognize that men, women, boys, girls and various groups, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, all are “affected by conflict in different ways.” The Air Force set up working groups to consider how different populations are affected by military policies. Aides to Mr. Hegseth said that he had spent the past week trying to draw attention away from negative articles in multiple news outlets about chaos at the Pentagon. Besides the public focus on — and an inspector general review into — his disclosures on the commercial chat app Signal of flight sequencing of American fighter jets in Yemen strikes, Mr. Hegseth has seen the dissolution of his inner circle of close advisers. Four members of the team he brought to the Pentagon have left the department, three of them accused of leaking information and escorted from the building. A fifth — his chief of staff — has also departed his post. Mr. Hegseth has refused to acknowledge that he did anything wrong in disclosing the Yemen strike details on Signal. On Tuesday, as he has done during much of his tenure as defense secretary, Mr. Hegseth was again taking aim at diversity and inclusion programs. When Mr. Trump signed the Women, Peace and Security Act into law in 2017, it was backed by a number of present-day Trump officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was a senator at the time, and the current national security adviser, Mike Waltz. Helene Cooper is a Pentagon correspondent for The Times. She was previously an editor, diplomatic correspondent and White House correspondent.

"A textile trade association that has backed President Trump’s trade strategy took issue with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s remark that emphasized “precision manufacturing” over clothing and fabrics.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by A textile trade association that has backed President Trump’s trade strategy took issue with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s remark that emphasized “precision manufacturing” over clothing and fabrics. By Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington American textile manufacturers pushed back on Tuesday against Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s suggestion that the industry was a thing of the past, arguing that U.S. makers of apparel and fabrics should not be overlooked as the Trump administration focuses on developing more advanced sectors. The backlash came as President Trump marked 100 days in office by highlighting what he considers his economic accomplishments and as top aides defended his aggressive use of tariffs. Mr. Bessent drew the textile industry’s ire when he said earlier in the day that Mr. Trump was interested in “the jobs of the future, not the jobs of the past” while explaining the president’s ambitions to spur domestic manufacturing. Mr. Bessent, a native of South Carolina, said at a White House press briefing, “We don’t need to necessarily have a booming textile industry where I grew up again, but we do want to have precision manufacturing and bring that back.” The National Association of Textile Organizations took offense, noting that it had been supportive of the Trump administration’s trade agenda, including the broad tariffs that Mr. Trump announced this month. The group pointed out that the U.S. textile industry produces more than 8,000 different products for the military and employed more than 470,000 workers last year. “Our industry saw your remarks and were disheartened to hear this sentiment, especially since this industry has been noted by President Trump himself on a number of occasions as critical and strategic,” Kimberly Glas, the trade group’s chief executive, wrote in a letter to Mr. Bessent. Critics of the Trump administration’s tariff strategy argue that the U.S. economy is heavily reliant on services and that efforts to reshore production of goods such as textiles would raise prices for consumers. Mr. Bessent was making the case that the Trump administration is focused on bolstering domestic manufacturing of products such as automobiles and items that are crucial to national security. Ms. Glas, who requested a meeting with Mr. Bessent, said that U.S. textile manufacturers should not be overlooked as they compete with Chinese producers that benefit from Beijing’s unfair trade practices. “This is a strategically important, relevant, and key industry,” Ms. Glas wrote. The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Alan Rappeport is an economic policy reporter for The Times, based in Washington. He covers the Treasury Department and writes about taxes, trade and fiscal matters.

"The women were sent to Europe to clear a backlog of 17 million pieces of mail waiting to be sent to U.S. troops.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The women were sent to Europe to clear a backlog of 17 million pieces of mail waiting to be sent to U.S. troops. By Karoun Demirjian Reporting from Washington The only all-Black, all-female Army battalion to serve in Europe during World War II was awarded Congress’s highest honor on Tuesday, in a celebration of the type of diversity that has come under assault by the Trump administration. The unit, the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion — known as the Six Triple Eight — deployed to England in 1945 to clear a backlog of 17 million letters and packages. The mail was considered critical to maintaining U.S. soldiers’ morale during some of the most grueling and bloody chapters of the war. The members of the 855-woman battalion were given six months to complete the mission, knowing that if they failed — as some military leaders believed they would — the future of Black women in the military might be doomed. They finished in three, working around the clock, processing up to 65,000 pieces of mail in each eight-hour shift, and creating a card-based index of over seven million military serial numbers to ensure that mail addressed to people with similar names would go to the correct recipient. Today, the battalion has only two surviving members: Fanny McClendon, 101, and Anna Mae Robertson, 104. While they watched from home, about 300 descendants of members of the battalion gathered in the Capitol’s Emancipation Hall — named after the enslaved people who helped construct the building — to witness a ceremony honoring the unit’s legacy. “We’re honored to host you and to celebrate these exceptional women,” Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who is a close ally of President Trump, said as he presented the award to the descendants of Lt. Col. Charity Adams, who as an Army major led the 6888th Battalion. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"The news organization relies almost exclusively on congressional funding, which the Trump administration has held up for weeks.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by The news organization relies almost exclusively on congressional funding, which the Trump administration has held up for weeks. By Minho Kim Reporting from Washington A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Tuesday to disburse congressionally approved grant money it has withheld from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a federally funded news organization that provides independent reporting in countries with limited press freedom. The judge, Royce C. Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, ordered the Trump administration to pay the news organization $12 million for its April funding. Judge Lamberth appeared to close a loophole from his previous ruling, which allowed the Trump administration to effectively hold funds for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty while facially complying with the court mandate. “In this case,” the judge wrote in his ruling, “it was Congress who ordained that the monies at issue” should go to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in legislation signed by President Trump himself. “In short: The current Congress and President Trump enacted a law allocating funds to the plaintiffs,” he concluded. The judge, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, also offered an unusual defense of the federal judiciary and its nonpartisan nature, as Mr. Trump has in recent months called for federal judges’ impeachment and his administration has teetered toward open defiance of courts in some cases. In recent months, Judge Lamberth wrote, “people from both inside and outside government have variously accused the courts — myself included — of fomenting a constitutional crisis, usurping the Article II powers of the presidency, undercutting the popular will or dictating how executive agencies can and should be run.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"In an interview with Dr. Phil, the health secretary offered false information about vaccine oversight and revealed a lack of basic understanding of new drug approvals.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by In an interview with Dr. Phil, the health secretary offered false information about vaccine oversight and revealed a lack of basic understanding of new drug approvals. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Christina Jewett Health policy and F.D.A. reporters Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. advised parents of newborns to “do your own research” before vaccinating their infants during a televised interview in which he also suggested the measles shot was unsafe and repeatedly made false statements that cast doubt on the benefits of vaccination and the independence of the Food and Drug Administration. Mr. Kennedy made the remarks to the talk show host Dr. Phil in an interview that aired Monday on MeritTV to mark the 100th day of the Trump administration. He said, as he has in the past, that “if you want to avoid spreading measles, the best thing you can do is take that vaccine.” But Mr. Kennedy also made clear, as he has in the past, that he believes it is up to individuals to decide. In suggesting vaccines are unsafe, he contradicted decades of advice from public health experts, including leaders of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “I would say that we live in a democracy, and part of the responsibility of being a parent is to do your own research,” the health secretary said, in response to a question from a woman in the audience who asked how he would advise a new parent about vaccine safety. “You research the baby stroller, you research the foods that they’re getting, and you need to research the medicines that they’re taking as well.” The phrase “I did my own research” became a cultural and political touchstone during the coronavirus pandemic, when proponents of vaccination, mostly on the political left, used it to denigrate those who had chosen not to get vaccinated. It became an internet meme and popped up on mock tombstones in Halloween-themed graveyards in liberal neighborhoods. The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Kennedy’s comments came amid the largest measles outbreak in about 25 years in the United States, which has included the deaths of two young children and an adult.

"Two new laws that were demanded by Gov. Ron DeSantis have entangled every level of government, unnerving residents who had long considered the state an immigrant haven.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Two new laws that were demanded by Gov. Ron DeSantis have entangled every level of government, unnerving residents who had long considered the state an immigrant haven. By Patricia Mazzei Reporting from Miami The year had barely begun when Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida demanded legislation cracking down on illegal immigration — before President Trump was inaugurated, and before any other state could beat him to it. The Republican governor got his wish. And now, the impact of the state’s new, aggressive enforcement powers is starting to become clear. The Trump administration has boasted of making hundreds of immigration arrests in Florida, with the state’s help. A South Florida detention center has added a plexiglass structure with rows of cots to deal with overcrowding. Mr. DeSantis and his handpicked attorney general, James Uthmeier, threatened to remove members of a City Council who initially opposed working with federal officials on immigration enforcement, accusing them of embracing “sanctuary policies.” In recent weeks, Mr. Uthmeier also seemed to defy a federal judge’s order on one of the new state laws. The judge, Kathleen M. Williams of the Federal District Court in Miami, temporarily blocked part of one law that makes it a state crime for unauthorized immigrants to enter Florida. Despite the judge’s order, Mr. Uthmeier told police officers that he “cannot prevent” them from making arrests under the law in question. Such has been the tumult playing out in Florida since Mr. DeSantis signed two sweeping immigration laws in February, saying that he wanted to be on the front lines of helping the Trump administration carry out mass deportations. The measures have entangled every level of state government and unnerved residents who had long considered Florida an immigrant haven. “I’ve never seen so many people so scared or concerned in 50 years that I’ve been working in Miami,” said Wilfredo O. Allen, an immigration lawyer. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"The Education Department’s civil rights office is investigating whether the program, which helps Black students do better academically, is racially discriminatory.",2025-04-29,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The Education Department’s civil rights office is investigating whether the program, which helps Black students do better academically, is racially discriminatory. By Michael C. Bender The Trump administration threatened on Tuesday to withhold federal funds from Chicago’s public schools over a program designed to help Black students do better academically, furthering the White House’s assault on liberal policies in education. The investigation, overseen by the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights, is based on a complaint from Parents Defending Education, a conservative, Virginia-based group that claims that the Chicago program, the Black Student Success Plan, amounted to racial discrimination. According to the complaint, the school district was “failing students of all races and ethnicities, which makes this racially segregated program all the more egregious.” A spokeswoman for the school district did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A news release from the district said the plan is part of the system’s “commitment to eliminating educational opportunity gaps and ensuring Black students have the support needed to achieve academic success and personal growth.” It involves “implementing culturally-responsive practices and instruction, ensuring equitable resource allocation, increasing the recruitment and retention of Black educators and leaders, and fostering meaningful engagement with Black students and families.” The Trump administration has slashed the number of civil rights investigators at the Education Department, but has also increased the number of inquiries into programs that administration officials think unfairly favor students based on race or grant special consideration to transgender students. One investigation took aim at Denver’s public school system over a gender-neutral bathroom at a school. An inquiry into the school district in Ithaca, N.Y., has focused on an annual “Students of Color United Summit,” which a conservative group known as the Equal Protection Project complained had discriminated against white students. The Education Department has also opened investigations into entire public school systems in California and Maine. The California inquiry concerns a state law protecting transgender students from disclosures to their parents. The Trump administration has threatened to withhold federal funding from Maine because the state ignored President Trump’s executive order barring transgender athletes who were assigned male at birth from participating in girls’ sports. Michael C. Bender is a Times political correspondent covering Donald J. Trump, the Make America Great Again movement and other federal and state elections.

"At a rally in Michigan, President Trump made false and exaggerated claims about his accomplishments, including on tariffs, immigration and his rollback of Biden administration policies.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","Tariffs Advertisement Supported by At a rally in Michigan, President Trump made false and exaggerated claims about his accomplishments, including on tariffs, immigration and his rollback of Biden administration policies. By Linda Qiu Within two minutes of speaking at a rally near Detroit to celebrate 100 days of his second term, President Trump told a lie: that he won Michigan “three times.” In fact, he lost the state in the 2020 election. What followed on Tuesday was an hour and a half filled with many familiar falsehoods and exaggerations about his accomplishments, including on tariffs, immigration and his rollback of Biden administration policies. Mr. Trump claimed an 87 percent decrease in the price of eggs and gas below $2 a gallon in three states. Both claims were overstated. The wholesale price of eggs has fallen by about 50 percent since he took office, but the retail price of eggs increased from January to March. And there is no state where gas is below $2 a gallon. He trumpeted the signing of an executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants. But three federal courts temporarily paused the order. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on the case in May. Mr. Trump claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency, the initiative led by the billionaire Elon Musk, had saved “$150 billion on waste, fraud and abuse.” While the initiative’s website highlights $160 billion in savings, reporting by The New York Times and other news outlets has shown that the figures it posted rely on inflated figures and errors, for example, including a $318 million contract that did not actually exist. He claimed that he had presided over a turnaround in military recruitment and that “nobody wanted to join the military” six months ago. Military recruitment actually began increasing before his election in November, and the Army recruited more people in August than in January or February.

"Border Patrol agents carried out sweeps in California’s Central Valley. Lawyers argued that people were stopped and arrested based on their skin color.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by Border Patrol agents carried out sweeps in California’s Central Valley. Lawyers argued that people were stopped and arrested based on their skin color. By Kate Selig In January, Border Patrol agents conducted sweeps through immigrant communities in California’s Central Valley, arresting nearly 80 individuals the agency said were unlawfully present in the United States. Officials said the operation, named “Return to Sender,” was intended to target undocumented immigrants with serious criminal backgrounds. But lawyers for those arrested argued that the agents had simply rounded up people who appeared to be day laborers and farm workers, regardless of their actual immigration status, without having a legally sound reason to suspect they were in the country illegally. On Tuesday, a federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction barring Border Patrol agents from stopping individuals without having a reasonable suspicion of illegal presence, as required by the Fourth Amendment. The judge also blocked agents from making warrantless arrests unless they have probable cause to believe the person is likely to flee before a warrant can be obtained. The Trump administration has adopted increasingly aggressive tactics in pursuit of its goal of mass deportations, but has faced pushback from the judiciary. The California ruling marks the latest attempt by courts to rein in enforcement actions that appear to conflict with long-established constitutional and legal protections. Judge Jennifer L. Thurston of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California noted in her ruling that the government did not “dispute or rebut” the “significant anecdotal evidence” from the plaintiffs regarding Border Patrol’s stop-and-arrest practices.

By Zolan Kanno-Youngs Reporting from Washington President Trump, whose administration has insisted it could not bring Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia back from El Salvador to the United States, said he does have the ability to help return the wrongly deported Maryland man, but is not willing to do so because he believes he is a gang member. “You could get him back, there’s a phone on this desk,” said Terry Moran, an ABC News correspondent, noting a Supreme Court order to “facilitate” the release of Mr. Abrego Garcia. “I could,” Mr. Trump replied. Mr. Moran said Mr. Trump could call President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador and get Mr. Abrego Garcia back immediately. “And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that,” Mr. Trump said. “But he is not.” Mr. Trump added that government lawyers do not want to help bring Mr. Abrego Garcia back to the United States. Mr. Trump’s comments not only undermined previous statements by his top aides, but were a blunt sign of his administration’s intention to double down and defy the courts. Before the interview with ABC News, the administration had dug in on its refusal to heed the Supreme Court order to help return Mr. Abrego Garcia, who is a Salvadoran migrant. Trump officials have said that because he was now in a Salvadoran prison, it was up to the Salvadoran government to release him. The Justice Department has argued that it can respond to the Supreme Court’s demand that the administration “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release by doing little more than letting him enter if he manages to present himself at a port of entry.

"The hourslong standoff ended when the man, a 29-year-old Guatemalan, surrendered to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in San Antonio.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by The hourslong standoff ended when the man, a 29-year-old Guatemalan, surrendered to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in San Antonio. By Edgar Sandoval Reporting from San Antonio U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in San Antonio arrested a man said to be an undocumented immigrant after a roughly eight-hour standoff that unfolded on Tuesday in a backyard where he tried to evade arrest by climbing a tree. The man, who immigration officials identified as Raul Ical, a 29-year-old from Guatemala, attracted a large crowd of residents and journalists. “You don’t have to sign anything,” yelled Jose Montoya, an activist with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a local advocacy group, as Mr. Ical climbed down a ladder that federal agents had placed in the backyard. When Mr. Ical surrendered, looking defeated, he was quickly handcuffed by agents. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said the episode was part of the Trump administration’s efforts to combat illegal immigration. “You can run, but you can’t hide,” she said in a statement. “Whether in a tree or harbored in an activist judge’s house, if you are here illegally, ICE will find you, arrest you and you will be deported.” ICE said that deportation officers in San Antonio and state police tried to serve Mr. Ical what the agency described as a “criminal warrant” on Tuesday morning before he left his vehicle and fled on foot. He ran into a backyard and climbed a tree, where he remained for hours, the authorities said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"Here’s what a variety of voters who made their choices in November’s election with some hesitation had to say about President Trump’s first 100 days.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by By The New York Times The first 100 days of President Trump’s second term have been a whirlwind of action, with the imposition of steep tariffs worldwide, the detention of immigrants and deep cuts to the federal work force. The New York Times has been talking with a group of voters who all cast their ballots in last November’s election with some trepidation. While they had expressed a range of hopes and concerns about the new administration, they have now seen enough to make some early judgments at the close of the first 100 days. (A recent Times/Siena College poll also found that majorities of voters, even many who approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing, view his first few months as “chaotic” and “scary.”) transcript Trump’s 100 first days have been kind of a mixed bag. I think for the most part, it’s been positive. And I still feel that I’ve made the right decision voting for Trump. As mayor of my small city here in Roma, Texas, I am concerned about the tariffs. We’ve recently developed a 300-plus-acre industrial park development for imports. The import of produce and other commodities. So we are concerned about how that’s going to affect our development. And we’ve gotten several investors to come in and look at our, this development wanting to invest. But some of them have actually told us, we’re very interested in developing in your city, however, because of the tariffs, we’re going to take a pause and see how things play out the next two, three, four months. As mayor of the small border town of Roma, Jaime Escobar Jr. was accustomed to assessing whether strategies were working. At this point, Mr. Escobar remained mostly optimistic, but he was still wary. “I’m not saying I’m 100 percent happy with everything, but for the most part, I feel that Trump is tackling the issues that the American voters thought were important,” he said, referring to immigration and the economy. “I don’t regret voting for him.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The United States has never seen an effort to expand presidential authority at the scale of Donald J. Trump’s second term.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","Trump Administration News Analysis The United States has never seen an effort to expand presidential authority at the scale of Donald J. Trump’s second term. News Analysis The United States has never seen an effort to expand presidential authority at the scale of Donald J. Trump’s second term. Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times Supported by By Charlie Savage Charlie Savage has been writing about presidential power for more than two decades. He reported from Washington. Nearly every president has pushed the bounds of executive power to try to achieve something specific. And a handful of presidents who took office during a true national crisis, like the Civil War or the depths of the Great Depression, swiftly made a series of legally aggressive moves to grapple with the challenges facing the country. But the sheer volume and intensity of the power grab President Trump has undertaken in the first 100 days of his second term — an assault on legal constraints untethered to any equivalent catastrophe — is unlike anything the United States has experienced. “They are trying to do a moonshot on executive power,” said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and senior Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration. The rule of law in the United States has been traditionally understood to use checks and balances to prevent too much concentration of arbitrary executive power. But the maximalist cascade in the early days of Mr. Trump’s second term is testing the fundamental structures of American democracy in a way that has never been seen before. Mr. Trump, pursuing a confrontational style of presidential politics, has unleashed an assault on counterweights to his authority: attacking judges, sidelining Congress’s role in making decisions about taxes and spending, steamrolling internal limits on the executive branch and using the levers of government to try to force outside centers of power like law firms and universities to submit to his will. Akhil Reed Amar, a Yale Law School professor, said the broader picture was of an administration that was “proudly lawless and anti-law.” The danger, he added, “is that Trump is the most powerful person in the world, and he does not seem to be very good at restraining himself and he’s not getting any younger.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The State Bar of California’s new exam has been rife with problems, an A.I. controversy and now the likelihood of delayed results.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by The State Bar of California’s new exam has been rife with problems, an A.I. controversy and now the likelihood of delayed results. By Orlando Mayorquín Reporting from Los Angeles Thousands of people took the new California bar exam in February, ready to the join the ranks of the state’s 195,000 lawyers. But a series of missteps by the institution responsible for licensing lawyers has thrown thousands of nascent legal careers into a frustrating limbo. First, there was the faulty testing software used during the exam. Test takers had trouble logging in. The software often crashed or was missing critical functions like copy and paste, leaving many unable to complete the exam. The organization that administers the test, the State Bar of California, had to offer adjustments of test-takers’ scores and other remedies. Then came the news that at least a handful of the multiple-choice questions had been developed with the help of artificial intelligence. To many of those who took the exam, it was hardly shocking — they already had suspicions that A.I. had been used, based on a few questions that they said had struck them as bizarrely worded or legally unsound. And now, California’s future lawyers are likely to have to wait a little longer to find out if they made the cut. The state bar said it would need more time to obtain approval from the Supreme Court of California to adjust test scores in light of the problems. The results of the February exam had been slated to be released on Friday, but that is likely to be delayed. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

Roosevelt. News Analysis Having escaped prison and death, President Trump has returned to power seeking vindication and vengeance — and done more in his first 100 days to change the trajectory of the country than any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. President Trump has acted like a man on a mission in the opening chapter of this new term, moving with almost messianic fervor to transform America from top to bottom and exact retribution against enemies at the same time.Credit...Al Drago for The New York Times Supported by By Peter Baker Peter Baker, the chief White House correspondent, is covering his sixth presidency and wrote a book about President Trump’s first term. He reported from Washington. At the entrance of the Oval Office, where the president and his visitors can see it every day, hangs the mug shot taken of a glowering Donald J. Trump after being arrested and charged with racketeering to overthrow an election. A couple of hundred feet away, in the grand foyer of the White House state floor where the official portraits of past presidents in solemn poses are on display, hangs a painting of a defiant Mr. Trump, blood splattered on his face by would-be assassin’s bullet, angrily pumping his fist and shouting, “Fight! Fight!” These icons of Mr. Trump’s journey back to power loom large as he completes the first 100 days of his second presidency. There is a reason he has placed these images in positions of prominence. They reflect the crucibles of a man who escaped existential threats of prison and death in his quest for vindication and vengeance. They fuel his self-authored narrative as a man of destiny, saved by God to save America. In the opening chapter of this new term, Mr. Trump has acted like a man on a mission, moving with almost messianic fervor to transform America from top to bottom and exact retribution against enemies at the same time. He appears intent on demolishing the old order no matter the collateral damage, putting his personal imprint not just on government and foreign affairs but on almost every aspect of national life, including business, culture, sports, academia, the legal world and the media. Through sheer force of will and brazen assertions of presidential power, Mr. Trump has done more to change the trajectory of the country in three months than any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced the notion of a first-100-days presidential yardstick. But where Roosevelt used his early weeks to build a new edifice, Mr. Trump has used his to tear it down. In effect, he is trying to repeal the liberal social compact and international system that Roosevelt constructed, “unwinding neoliberalism,” as one aide put it. Nearly every day brings a fresh breach of what were once thought to be the rules, moves that have thrilled his insurgent supporters and petrified his nervous opponents. In his own telling, Mr. Trump is putting America on the path to the “golden age” that he promised in his inaugural address, while his adversaries fear that it is instead the path to a new dark age of autocracy, repression and upheaval.

"The justices have allowed vouchers for religious schools and required equal treatment in tuition programs. But direct government payments to religious public schools pose a new test.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","Religious Charter School Challenge Advertisement Supported by The justices have allowed vouchers for religious schools and required equal treatment in tuition programs. But direct government payments to religious public schools pose a new test. By Adam Liptak Reporting from Washington The Supreme Court appeared open on Wednesday to allowing Oklahoma to use government money to run the nation’s first religious charter school, which would teach a curriculum infused by Catholic doctrine. Excluding the school from the state’s charter-school system would amount to “rank discrimination against religion,” Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said during the oral argument. The main question in the case is whether the First Amendment permits — or even requires — states to sponsor and finance religious charter schools, which are public schools with substantial autonomy. A decision endorsing such schools would spur their spread, extend religion’s extraordinary winning streak at the Supreme Court and further lower the wall separating church and state. The Oklahoma school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, is to be operated by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa, and it aims to incorporate Catholic teachings into every aspect of its activities. After Oklahoma’s charter school board approved the proposal to open St. Isidore, the state’s attorney general, Gentner Drummond, sued to stop it. Mr. Drummond, a Republican, said a religious public school would violate the First Amendment’s prohibition of government establishment of religion and the State Constitution’s ban on spending public money to support religious institutions. The justices appeared to be divided along the usual ideological lines, with the court’s Republican appointees largely sympathetic to the school and its Democratic ones quite wary. But Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, raising the possibility of a tie vote if a single Republican appointee joined the three Democratic ones. That would leave a state court decision rejecting the school intact. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

"Republicans have raced to approve the president’s picks to serve as top diplomats around the globe, in some cases with solid backing from Democrats.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","Trump Administration Advertisement Supported by Republicans have raced to approve the president’s picks to serve as top diplomats around the globe, in some cases with solid backing from Democrats. By Robert Jimison Reporting from the Capitol Late last month, President Trump began grumbling — first quietly and privately, then publicly — that the Senate was moving too slowly to confirm his picks to fill highly sought ambassadorships around the world. Mere weeks later, Senate Republicans have vastly stepped up their pace in approving his nominees, installing nearly a dozen mostly wealthy loyalists as envoys to key countries and moving more quickly than other presidents have in the past few decades. The flurry of confirmations — 10 in Mr. Trump’s first 100 days in office — has already outpaced his most recent predecessors and that of his first term, and it comes as the president and his team have undertaken a broader effort to reshape the State Department and U.S. diplomacy. Unlike some of his cabinet nominees, most have sailed through with unanimous Republican support and at least some backing from Democrats. That was the case on Tuesday, when the Senate voted 67 to 29 to confirm David Perdue, the former senator from Georgia and businessman, to be the U.S. ambassador to China. His approval did not come as a surprise. Mr. Perdue maintains close relationships with many of his former colleagues and at his hearing earlier this month, he was spared critical questions on topics such as his past criticism of across-the-board tariffs or when he boasted about frequently moving American jobs overseas during his time as a business executive. Instead, Mr. Perdue said he would dutifully carry out the president’s agenda and, like other Trump appointees to serve as top diplomats around the globe, affirmed his commitment to project an “America First” agenda while stationed abroad.

"The virtual school, named for the patron saint of the internet, would be funded by Oklahoma taxpayers and incorporate Catholic teachings into its curriculum.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","Religious Charter School Challenge Advertisement Supported by The virtual school, named for the patron saint of the internet, would be funded by Oklahoma taxpayers and incorporate Catholic teachings into its curriculum. By Sarah Mervosh St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, the school at the center of Wednesday’s case, has not yet opened its doors. In fact, it does not have doors to open. If the Supreme Court allows it to proceed, St. Isidore will be an online school, an alternative to traditional schooling that has been growing in popularity for years and proliferated during the pandemic. Named for the patron saint of the internet, St. Isidore aims to become the nation’s first charter school with an explicitly religious curriculum. It would serve students in kindergarten through high school across the state of Oklahoma, seeking to bring Catholic education particularly to rural areas where many families do not have access to Catholic schools. As an arm of the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa, the school would have “a strong Catholic identity,” according to the school’s website. In religion class, students would learn about Catholic saints, the Ten Commandments and other aspects of Catholic doctrine, according to the website. But other subjects may also incorporate elements of religion. For example, in science, students would learn about the contributions of Catholic scientists, like Copernicus and Galileo. Sample reading lists for high school English classes include classics like the “Odyssey” and “Don Quixote,” as well as Catholic readings such as “The Place Within,” a poetry collection by Pope John Paul II. The school, which estimates an initial capacity of 500 students, would also hold two in-person Masses each year, in Oklahoma City and Tulsa. It would be open to students of all religious faiths. But as a private employer, it would be free to discriminate in hiring by, for example, showing preference to Catholic applicants or rejecting L.G.B.T.Q. candidates, an issue that may come up in the court’s arguments on Wednesday.

"The justice will not participate in oral argument, deliberations or vote. She gave no explanation.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","Religious Charter School Challenge Advertisement Supported by The justice will not participate in oral argument, deliberations or vote. She gave no explanation. By Abbie VanSickle and Sarah Mervosh When the justices take the bench for oral arguments on Wednesday, one seat will be empty: Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the junior member of the court’s conservative supermajority, has recused herself from the case, which means she will not take part in the oral arguments, deliberations or vote. The justice did not provide an explanation for her recusal, but it may have to do with her close friendship with Nicole Stelle Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who was an early adviser for St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, the school involved in the dispute. The two clerked together on the Supreme Court in the late 1990s, and then became neighbors in South Bend, Ind., and colleagues for many years at Notre Dame. Their families are close, and Justice Barrett is the godmother to one of Ms. Garnett’s children. Ms. Garnett has described the pair’s lives as “completely intertwined.” “Amy Barrett and I have been close friends since the year we clerked together, but we don’t talk about the law,” Ms. Garnett said in an interview in 2023. “We talk about our kids.” She declined to comment on Justice Barrett’s recusal, and the justice did not respond to a request to comment. Ms. Garnett is not listed as a lawyer on the case, but she has been a leading voice arguing for religious charter schools and has provided advice to St. Isidore. She has also worked with Notre Dame Law School’s Religious Liberty Clinic, which is part of St. Isidore’s legal team. Although justices sometimes provide reasons when they recuse themselves, they are not required to. That practice was codified in the fall of 2023, when the justices announced the court’s first ethics code. The code followed months of revelations that some justices, most prominently Justice Clarence Thomas, had failed to disclose luxury travels and gifts from wealthy benefactors. One major question during the debate over the ethics code was when justices must step away from a case because of an actual or perceived conflict of interest. The policy is far looser than that for lower court judges. The justices each decide for themselves, rarely recuse and never have to share their reasoning. According to reporting by The New York Times, during internal conversations, several of the justices had focused on their “duty to sit,” or obligation to hear cases, pointing out that if a justice recuses, there is no one to take that justice’s place.

By Sarah Mervosh The very identity of the nation’s 8,100 charter schools is on the line on Wednesday, as the Supreme Court considers whether they are fundamentally public or private institutions. If they are public, there is little room for religious instruction, as proposed by the school at the center of the case, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which seeks to open in Oklahoma as the nation’s first religious charter school. But if they are private, as St. Isidore’s lawyers will argue, banning a religious group from operating a charter school when other nonprofits are free to do so would be religious discrimination. If the Supreme Court decides charter schools are private, it would most likely allow St. Isidore to open, and potentially pave the way for religious charter schools in other states. Charter schools, which were created in the 1990s to give families more options, have long occupied a hybrid space in education. They are like traditional public schools in many ways because they are paid for by taxpayers and free to attend. But charter schools are also run by private entities, often nonprofits, and are not zoned, allowing students to attend regardless of their ZIP codes. And unlike at many public schools, their teachers typically are not unionized. Today, about 3.7 million students attend charter schools, in 44 states and Washington, D.C., representing about 7 percent of the public school sector. But in some cities, like Detroit and Philadelphia, enrollment is far greater, representing a third to half of all students. Whether they should be classified as public or private may hinge on the specifics of Oklahoma state law. Justices will most likely consider technical issues, like how charter schools are created. In Oklahoma, a state board must approve new charter schools, a fact that many in the mainstream charter school movement argue places them firmly in the public realm. “A charter school doesn’t exist unless the government gives it reason to open,” said Starlee Coleman, president of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, which opposes allowing religious institutions to operate charter schools. Lawyers for St. Isidore say that it was created by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa and that it is operated by a board of private citizens. They will argue that St. Isidore is a private school with a government contract. Any ruling in favor of St. Isidore could have broad implications. Twelve Republican-leaning states filed an amicus brief in support of St. Isidore’s petition, while 18 states, mostly Democratic-leaning, opposed.

"New details deepen questions about the deportations, showing that El Salvador’s president pressed for assurances that the migrants were really members of the Tren de Aragua gang.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration  New details deepen questions about the deportations, showing that El Salvador’s president pressed for assurances that the migrants were really members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Credit... Supported by By Zolan Kanno-YoungsHamed AleazizAlan FeuerDevlin BarrettJulie TurkewitzJonathan SwanMaggie Haberman and Annie Correal The reporters interviewed government officials, lawyers for deported migrants and relatives of migrants in the United States and Venezuela. They also reviewed internal records and court filings. As they addressed reporters inside the Oval Office in mid-April, President Trump and his Salvadoran counterpart appeared to be operating in lock step. The United States had just deported more than 200 migrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, and President Nayib Bukele said his country was eager to take more. He scoffed at a question from a reporter about whether he would release one of the men who a federal judge said had been mistakenly deported. “I mean, we’re not very fond of releasing terrorists into our country,” Mr. Bukele said. But weeks earlier, when the three planes of deportees landed, it was the Salvadoran president who had quietly expressed concerns. As part of the agreement with the Trump administration, Mr. Bukele had agreed to house only what he called “convicted criminals” in the prison. However, many of the Venezuelan men labeled gang members and terrorists by the U.S. government had not been tried in court. Mr. Bukele wanted assurances from the United States that each of those locked up in the prison was members of Tren de Aragua, the transnational gang with roots in Venezuela, according to people familiar with the situation and documents obtained by The New York Times.

By Zolan Kanno-YoungsHamed AleazizDevlin BarrettJonathan SwanMaggie Haberman and Annie Correal President Trump’s deportation in March of more than 200 alleged gang members from Venezuela to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador has emerged as a flashpoint in his administration’s use of wartime powers to expel immigrants. Lawyers for those deported say the March 15 operation circumvented due process and swept up those who are not gang members. The Supreme Court is now poised to weigh in on how the White House has sought to apply the Alien Enemies Act, which had previously only been invoked by presidents in time of war. A team of reporters from The New York Times reviewed court filings and government documents and interviewed government officials and lawyers for deportees and their relatives to reconstruct how the United States secured the deal with El Salvador and seized on the law to supercharge its deportation efforts. Here are five takeaways. President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has championed President Trump and his immigration agenda and publicly celebrated the arrival of the deportees from the United States. But behind the scenes, Mr. Bukele expressed concern about whom the United States sent to be imprisoned in his new Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, according to according to people familiar with the situation and documents obtained by The New York Times. During the negotiations, Mr. Bukele told U.S. officials he would take only what he described as “convicted criminals” from other countries. He made it clear that he did not want migrants from other nations whose only crime was being in the United States illegally. We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

"The New York Republican is contemplating a run for governor and nursing a feud with the House speaker after seeing her cabinet dream evaporate.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","Trump Administration  The New York Republican is contemplating a run for governor and nursing a feud with the Speaker Mike Johnson after her cabinet nomination was withdrawn. The nomination of Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, to be President Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations was pulled to protect Republicans’ thin margin in the House.Credit...Graham Dickie/The New York Times Supported by By Annie Karni Reporting from the Capitol Styrofoam packing peanuts littered an empty office in the Rayburn House Office Building across from the Capitol on Monday morning as two moving men unpacked a plush couch, an upholstered armchair, lamps and a lucite side table. Representative Elise Stefanik of New York was back. This had not been the plan. Ms. Stefanik, the self-proclaimed “ultra MAGA” warrior whom President Trump nominated to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, had expected to sail through her Senate confirmation vote, which was to be scheduled in early April. So she boxed up her office. She sent off her longtime chief of staff, Patrick Hester, to start a new job at the State Department, where he ended up working for seven days. She completed a “farewell tour” of her district, checked out schools for her son in New York City and was looking forward to moving into the $15 million Manhattan penthouse that comes with what is considered a fairly cushy job. Instead, Ms. Stefanik was back here on Capitol Hill amid the peanuts, contemplating her next steps and pinning most of the blame for what happened on Speaker Mike Johnson. To detractors, the president’s decision to pull Ms. Stefanik’s nomination was something akin to karmic comeuppance for a Republican lawmaker who was elected as a moderate but tacked unapologetically to the MAGA right, coming to personify the opportunistic shape-shifting that has gripped her party in the age of Mr. Trump. Ms. Stefanik’s plight seemed to crystallize in one succinct cautionary tale the limits of loyalty in the MAGA universe. Even one of the president’s most stalwart defenders, an effective ally since his first impeachment trial, ultimately did not get what she had long been promised.

"It remained unclear whether the diplomatic effort was a genuine bid by the White House to address the plight of the immigrant, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","U.S. Immigration Advertisement Supported by It remained unclear whether the diplomatic effort was a genuine bid by the White House to address the plight of the immigrant, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia. By Michael S. SchmidtAlan FeuerZolan Kanno-YoungsMaggie Haberman and Maria Abi-Habib The Trump administration recently sent a diplomatic note to officials in El Salvador to inquire about releasing a Salvadoran immigrant whom government officials have been ordered by the Supreme Court to help free, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. But the authoritarian government of Nayib Bukele, the leader of El Salvador, said no, two of the people said. The Bukele administration claimed the man should stay in El Salvador because he was a Salvadoran citizen, according to one of those people. It remained unclear whether the diplomatic effort was a genuine bid by the White House to address the plight of the immigrant, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, whom administration officials have repeatedly acknowledged was improperly expelled to El Salvador last month in violation of a court order expressly prohibiting him from being sent there. Some legal experts suggested that the sequence of events could have been an attempt at window dressing by officials seeking to give the appearance of being in compliance with the recent Supreme Court ruling ordering the White House to “facilitate” Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release. The disclosure about the note adds to the confusion about the Trump administration’s efforts to free Mr. Abrego Garcia and whether it is seeking to comply with court orders. Even as the administration appeared to be moving privately to work toward Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release, it has publicly expressed unwillingness to bring him back to the United States. The revelation came just hours after the president, reversing course on his administration’s previous statements, said in an interview with ABC News that he had the ability to bring Mr. Abrego Garcia back. The president added that he did not believe Mr. Abrego Garcia was a good person and that his administration’s lawyers would decide. The Justice Department is also facing a court-ordered deadline of early next week to provide information about what it has done to seek his freedom.

"Sheila, a local man’s pet, escaped her enclosure and decided to hit the road.",2025-04-30,"The New York Times","Advertisement Supported by Sheila, a local man’s pet, escaped her enclosure and decided to hit the road. transcript “What the —?” “Something must have got loose. They’ve been stopping — they got cops all up and down the road.” “What the — hell? Where are you going, buddy? Wow.” By Victor Mather Let’s take a look at the latest news out of Macon County, Ala. “A two-vehicle crash occurred at approximately 11:50 a.m. on Tuesday, April 29.” OK, not much to see there. Guess it’s worth finishing the sentence though. “Involving a kangaroo.” Ding. Ding. Ding. Yes, that was a kangaroo on Interstate 85 between the cities of Auburn and Tuskegee on Tuesday. Video taken from a vehicle just behind the ’roo shows it hopping along the left side of the road accompanied by an understandable “What the … ?” from an occupant of the car. The kangaroo smoothly crosses the road and continues hopping on the right side. Let’s be friendly about this though. The kangaroo has a name: Sheila. And don’t worry. She’s OK. Law enforcement officials shut the interstate in both directions for the safety of the kangaroo and motorists. The kangaroo’s owner, Patrick Starr, was also called to the scene. Mr. Starr runs Choctafaula Ranch, an agricultural tourism site southwest of Auburn, with a pumpkin patch, petting zoo and the like, although the kangaroo was a private pet, he said. Mr. Starr said that Sheila’s enclosure was somehow compromised “in the real wee hours of the morning around 6 a.m.” “As soon as we were up that morning we started getting calls,” he said. “I reached out to local law enforcement. We’re adjacent to the interstate, and it got onto the interstate. We located it in about 10 to 15 minutes, fairly quick.” Luckily for posterity, Sheriff André Brunson of Macon County took video to record the culmination of the incident. When the video starts, the kangaroo has already been hit by a tranquilizer dart fired by Mr. Starr but is still loose. “A kangaroo in Macon County, Ala.,” Sheriff Brunson marvels. He then gets out of his car and puts on a cowboy hat with a badge on it. “We’re going to see if we can apprehend this kangaroo.” “When somebody said there was a kangaroo, of course I didn’t believe him, and nobody believed him,” Sheriff Brunson says. “But I’m looking at him.” The video shows Mr. Starr picking up the sleepy marsupial and carrying her to his car. “We see a little bit of everything here,” Sheriff Brunson says. And let’s end with the good news that everyone most wants to hear. The car accident on the interstate was minor, Mr. Starr said, with no injuries or damage, perhaps caused by astonished drivers rubbernecking. And, Mr. Starr said Wednesday, Sheila is “not injured at all; she woke up like normal.” Kitty Bennett contributed research.
